Wrong attribution of eigenvector centrality#TITLE_END#This is not exactly a bug, but...  The documentation of eigenvector_centrality() claims that it has been introduced by Bonacich in 1986, referring to a paper.  However, eigenvector centrality was introduced (for chess tournaments) by Edmund Landau in 1895 (Edmund Landau. Zur relativen Wertbemessung der Turnierresultate. Deutsches Wochenschach, 11:366–369, 1895.). It has been reintroduced several times, in particular for general social graphs by Berge in 1958 (Claude Berge. Théorie des graphes et ses applications. Dunod, Paris, France, 1958).  Technically this is not a bug, but I think it would be good if references to mathematical concepts in NetworkX were to the actual inventor. I can amend the documentation if there's interest in it.

Harmonic diameter#TITLE_END#This PR implements the harmonic diameter, a measure of connectivity.

Random trees & forests#TITLE_END#This is a pull request stemming from the long discussion here: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/6506  The pull request introduces new functions to generate (un)labeled (rooted) trees and rooted forests. The original `random_tree` function is copied verbatim, but it now issues a deprecation warning as it is problematic.  Code coverage is 99%. All algorithms used are documented with reference to the literature.  This pull request is joint work of:  Paolo Boldi Flavio Furia Davide D'Ascenzo Sebastiano Vigna  How should we manage to add the name in case it is accepted?

Update to the documentation of eigenvector centrality#TITLE_END#Following up to #6004 , I'm trying to rewrite the documentation, fixing also a number of small mistakes and making some assumption in the code explicit (like the usage of the Euclidian norm).  I just modified the documentation for `eigenvector_centrality`: `eigenvector_centrality_numpy` can then be copied (in fact, it would be better to have a reference to `eigenvector_centrality` IMHO).  Please let me know if it sounds sensible. I tried to be as precise as possible without introducing too many concepts.
issue
Please document the formatting rules and tools in the contribution guide#TITLE_END#I have spent the last few hours installing ruff, black, pylint, I don't know how many tools, but I could not find any way, from the CI output or from the contribution guide that explains how code contributed to NetworkX should be formatted. The CI checks for code format won't go through.  It would be very useful if the contribution guide would explicitly name the tool and the option that will make the code pass the CI checks. I have tried my best to deduce it, but I'm stymied. It is really frustrating.  UPDATE: from what I understand, you must run `black` followed by `ruff --fix` _exactly in this order_.
issue
Fixed test for average shortest path in the case of directed graphs#TITLE_END#The code for `average_shortest_path_length()` contains a mathematical error: it computes a value for directed graphs that are just weakly connected instead of strongly connected. This approach has no mathematical sense: for example, the current code in the case of the directed graph 0 → 1 returns 1/2, because it adds a single distance $d(0,1)=1$ but then divides by the number of possible distances (2).  In other words, the current code adds $k$ lengths (where $k$ is the number of reachable pairs) and then divides by $n(n-1)$. It is not an average in any possible mathematical sense when $k\neq n(n-1)$.  This fix simply change the wrong test for weak connectivity to a test for strong connectivity, updating the documentation.  A sensible notion of diameter for directed graphs that are not strongly connected (or undirected graphs that are not connected) is the harmonic diameter (#5251).

For $\alpha = 1/\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ the summation does not converge. Convergence is possible only when $\alpha < 1/\lambda_\mathrm{max}$.  In the limit case, for $\alpha \to 1/\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ there is some theory that will tell you where Katz index is going, and in particular for strongly connected graphs (of at least for a semisimple $\lambda_\mathrm{max}$) it is the dominant eigenvector, but when the graph is not strongly connected there are many such vectors and the situation is a bit complicated. I know because I [proved the result in full generality](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/spectral-ranking/99ACDCD0CC1B774AB0041FB16AB43D1B). What you get is the projection of the preference vector onto the eigenspace.

OK, I just read the definition and actually it's a bit weird but the original statement was correct. If $\beta=0$, this is not Katz centrality. It is eigenvector centrality, period. And it will have a solution only if $\alpha$ is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue. Simply, in the definition, it should be $\beta > 0$.  What is true is when $\beta > 0$ if you let $\alpha$ go to the limit value you will tend in the direction of the dominant eigenvector, or more generally in the direction of the projection of the preference vector onto the dominant eigenspace. (You'll need to renormalize tho as the vector norm will go to infinity).  BTW, $\beta$ can be different for every node, _and the code allows that_, so probably it would be better to have a definition matching the code, with a parameter $\beta_i$ instead of the same $\beta$ for all nodes.  Said that, I've always seen Katz centrality defined as $\beta \sum_{n\geq 0}A^nx^n$ (here $\beta$ is a vector but I can't bold it), and while this definition is equivalent, I don't think it is really idiomatic. The original formulation by Katz is in terms of an attenuated path summation (voters of voters of voters...). The linear recurrence in the paper is derived much later.

> Excellent @vigna Can you suggest some wording here relating it to the eigenvector centrality? Or is that difficult.... >  > Maybe something like: For strongly connected graphs, as α→1/λmax and beta=1 this approaches the result for eigenvector centrality.  Yes, this is correct for every $\beta\neq 0$. If you want a precise explanation for the non-strongly-connected case just put a reference to my paper, it is definitely _not_ something you want to explain in general documentation...

Can this be merged?

Oops. I didn't even realize this is not my branch. I guess I should fork from this branch or something like that?
