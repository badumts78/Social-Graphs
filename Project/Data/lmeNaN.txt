Fix write_gexf timeformat for dynamic Graphs#TITLE_END#When using write_gexf on a Graph containing start/end attributes, the Graph timeformat parameter was not set, breaking compatibility with the [gexf draft](https://gexf.net/1.2draft/gexf-12draft-primer.pdf). This ensures that the timeformat parameter is set in the .gexf <graph> tag.   Before this fix, the .gexf file obtained when using write_gexf on a dynamic graph would not contain a timeformat attribute in the graph tag. This made read_gexf unable to parse the Graph.  After this fix, the timeformat argument for the graph tag is saved on line 6 of the gexf file, ensuring that a dynamic Graph exported through write_gexf can then be loaded again through read_gexf.
