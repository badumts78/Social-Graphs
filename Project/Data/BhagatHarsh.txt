issue
Adding links to README.rst#TITLE_END#<!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code. For more details check out step 1 and 4 of https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html -->  I just started to read through the documentation.   There are three files that were mentioned in the README.rst but were not referenced using hyperlinks.  I thought it might help if they can be just clicked and opened directly.
