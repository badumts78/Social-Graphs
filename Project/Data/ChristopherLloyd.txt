split-decomposition via graph-labelled-trees#TITLE_END#Cunningham's split decomposition revisited by Gioan and Paul via graph-labelled-trees can be computed in linear time. ---> a paper b Gioan-Paul: https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3283   It enables one to efficiently identify the membership of graphs to certain classes such as circle-graphs and distance-hereditary, and wikipedia mentions several other applications providing references. ---> another paper by Gioan-Paul : https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1823 ---> wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(graph_theory)  This decomposition is used in current research and it would be good to be able to play with it experimentally, as well as to use it to solve the afore mentioned problems.
