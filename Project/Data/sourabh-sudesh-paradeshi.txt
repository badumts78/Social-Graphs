Add is_perfect_graph function and tests using Strong Perfect Graph Theorem#TITLE_END#This PR adds the is_perfect_graph function to check whether an undirected graph is perfect, based on the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem (SPGT).  Returns True if neither the graph nor its complement contains an induced odd cycle of length ≥ 5.  Uses cycle_basis to detect induced odd holes and antiholes.  Includes a fast check using chordality and an optional max_cycle_length parameter.  Adds tests for complete graphs, odd/even cycles, and complements.  This complements NetworkX’s structural graph tools by enabling efficient perfectness checks.

Add claw_graph, paw_graph, and bowtie_graph to small graph generators#TITLE_END#### Summary  This PR adds three standard named graphs to `networkx.generators.small`:  - `claw_graph`: the star \( K_{1,3} \), important in claw-free graph characterizations. - `paw_graph`: triangle with a pendant vertex; used in threshold and split graph theory. - `bowtie_graph`: two triangles sharing a vertex (also called the butterfly graph).  Each function: - Uses `@_raise_on_directed` and `@_dispatchable` - Returns a named `Graph` in NetworkX style - Matches the design of other small graphs like `bull_graph` and `house_graph`  These graphs are useful in forbidden subgraph theory and small graph classification.
