Corrects incorrect requirements for values of Tau1 and Tau2 in docs.#TITLE_END#Fixes #2922 
issue
For LFR Benchmark Graph Generation, the docs do not match the parameter requirements#TITLE_END#A user reading the online or inline documentation will read the following potential raised errors when using the LFR benchmark graph generation function: ``` Raises     ------     NetworkXError         If any of the parameters do not meet their upper and lower bounds:          - ``tau1`` and ``tau2`` must be less than or equal to one.         - ``mu`` must be in [0, 1].         - ``max_degree`` must be in {1, ..., *n*}.         - ``min_community`` and ``max_community`` must be in {0, ...,           *n*}.          If not exactly one of ``average_degree`` and ``min_degree`` is         specified.          If ``min_degree`` is not specified and a suitable ``min_degree``         cannot be found. ```  However, this is not how this function behaves. Below, note the inequality checks on tau and tau2:  ```     if not tau1 > 1:         raise nx.NetworkXError("tau1 must be greater than one")     if not tau2 > 1:         raise nx.NetworkXError("tau2 must be greater than one") ```  Either the docs need to be updated to reflect tau1, tau2 > 1 or the inline inequality checks need to be modified to allow tau1 and tau2 to equal 1.
