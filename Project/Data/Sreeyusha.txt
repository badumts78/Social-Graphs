Hi @MridulS. I have a small doubt regarding this issue. In this issue, do we have to create a doc with instructions about how to set up GitHub codespaces? Please help me to clear my doubt. Thank you.

Hi @MridulS. As you suggested earlier that does not work on this issue. I am unable to find some good first issues. Could you please suggest some beginner-friendly issues. I would be grateful for your help. Thank you,
