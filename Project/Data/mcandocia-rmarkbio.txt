issue
call to cluster() in average_cluster() can return incorrect type if None in graph.#TITLE_END#It is possible for `cluster()` to return an integer instead of a dictionary, which causes an `AttributeError` to be raised. This occurs if `None` is in the graph.  Inadvertently discovered this through a bug in my own code, but allowing `None` to be an ID as well as using it as a default argument that can be misinterpreted seems to be an issue here, and possibly in other functions, as well.  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py#L260  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py#L366
