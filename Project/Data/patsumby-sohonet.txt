Add function to calculate weight of a specific path#TITLE_END#I can create a graph with edges with multiple attirbute weights on the edges (ie $cost and latency).  I can identify the shortest path based on cost or the shortest path based on latency.  What I can't do is find the cost of the shortest latency path or find the latency of lowest cost path.  I've worked around this by writing a helper function as follows:   ```python def cost_of_path(graph,path,metric):         total = 0         hops = len(path)         for i in range(1,hops):                 value = min([v[metric] for v in graph[path[i]][path[i-1]].values()])                 total += value         return total  cost_of_path( G, [A,B,C], "latency") # returns latency of this path cost_of_path( G, [A,C], "cost") # returns $ cost of this path ```  [A.B,C] is the lowest $ cost path. [A,C] is the lowest latency path  Seems this should be easy enough to add in and would be a useful function of the system.  The "min([v[metric] for v in graph[path[i]][path[i-1]].values()])" line is because I'm using a multigraph and there are potentially multiple edges between some pairs of nodes.  Loving networkx though, very useful.
