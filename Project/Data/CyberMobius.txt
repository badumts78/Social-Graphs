For what it's worth, I'm working on a new algorithm for maximum spanning arborescence as part of #3825. Progress on it has been pretty slow but hopefully whenever I finish that out it squashes the bug you're having and brings with it a boost in performance.   I don't know too much about the current algorithm but if anyone really wanted to look into it, my best guess would be to look into how it handles circuits. Since it starts by picking enough edges for an arborescence as well as some extra ones, it ends up creating loops. It then selects which edges from the loops to discard to create a maximum arborescence. I suspect there might be a bug in either how it creates loops or how it discards edges from them (or both). The loops are created by iterating through the nodes in the order that they are added so it would explain why shuffling the order of the nodes changes the output.   Either way I'll try and get a PR for the new algorithm ASAP.
