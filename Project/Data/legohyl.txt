issue
Keep edge orientation in undirected graphs#TITLE_END#Is there any way to preserve the orientation of edges, even if it's an undirected graph? I get the following: ``` t = nx.Graph() t.add_nodes_from([1,2,3]) t.add_edges_from([(2,1), (3,1)]) ``` output: ``` list(t.edges())  [(1, 2), (1, 3)] ```  I understand that this can be solved if we use a `DiGraph` but is there any chance I can preserve the orientation without using it?
