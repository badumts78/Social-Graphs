issue
`chordless_cycles` raises an exception for some multi-graphs#TITLE_END#### Steps to reproduce The following script triggers the error: ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.MultiGraph() G.add_node(1) G.add_node(2) G.add_edge(1, 1) G.add_edge(2, 2) G.add_edge(1, 2) G.add_edge(1, 2)  # Will print [1], [2], [2, 1], then raise an exception for c in nx.chordless_cycles(G):     print(c) ``` The script creates a multi-graph with two nodes. Each node has a self-loop and there are two edges going between the two nodes. It will print 3 cycles and then it raises the following exception:  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/Users/patmjen/miniconda3/envs/networkx_bug/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py", line 1134, in remove_edge     del self._adj[u][v]         ~~~~~~~~~^^^ KeyError: 2  The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "bug.py", line 12, in <module>     for c in nx.chordless_cycles(G):              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^   File "miniconda3/envs/networkx_bug/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/cycles.py", line 628, in chordless_cycles     F.remove_edge(u, v)     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^   File "miniconda3/envs/networkx_bug/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py", line 1138, in remove_edge     raise NetworkXError(f"The edge {u}-{v} is not in the graph") from err networkx.exception.NetworkXError: The edge 2-1 is not in the graph ``` I would expect it the function either handle the graph without exceptions or raise an exception before it starts to yield any cycles to tell me I have an invalid graph.  The reason it errors when trying to remove the `(u, v)` edge from `F` is because `F` is empty.  `F` is created on L592 as `F = nx.Graph((u, v) for u, Gu in G.adj.items() if u not in Gu for v in Gu)`. Since both nodes have a self-loop, `u` is always in its adjecency list, so the if condition is never true. Therefore, nothing gets added to `F`.  In the [documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cycles.chordless_cycles.html) it is stated that "*We interpret self-loops to be chordless cycles, except in multigraphs with multiple loops in parallel. Likewise, in a chordless cycle of length greater than 1, there can be no nodes with self-loops.*". As I understand, the correct behavior would then be to only report the two self-loops and the reporting of `[2, 1]` is incorrect?  In any case, thanks for a great library!  ### Environment My OS is macOS Sequoia v15.3.1  ``` # packages in environment at miniconda3/envs/networkx_bug: # # Name                    Version                   Build  Channel bzip2                     1.0.8                h80987f9_6   ca-certificates           2024.12.31           hca03da5_0   expat                     2.6.4                h313beb8_0   libcxx                    14.0.6               h848a8c0_0   libffi                    3.4.4                hca03da5_1   libmpdec                  4.0.0                h80987f9_0   ncurses                   6.4                  h313beb8_0   networkx                  3.4.2                    pypi_0    pypi openssl                   3.0.15               h80987f9_0   pip                       25.0            py313hca03da5_0   python                    3.13.2          h4862095_100_cp313   python_abi                3.13                    0_cp313   readline                  8.2                  h1a28f6b_0   setuptools                75.8.0          py313hca03da5_0   sqlite                    3.45.3               h80987f9_0   tk                        8.6.14               h6ba3021_0   tzdata                    2025a                h04d1e81_0   wheel                     0.45.1          py313hca03da5_0   xz                        5.6.4                h80987f9_1   zlib                      1.2.13               h18a0788_1  ```
