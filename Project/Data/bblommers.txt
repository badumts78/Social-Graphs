Patch for outdated releases (2.2)?#TITLE_END#I'm workign on a project that still supports Py2, and our tests just started failing because of a new release of the `decorator` dependency. The new 5.0 release has dropped support for Py2, breaking some of our tests.  The last networkx release that supports Py2, 2.2, has an unbound dependency for `decorator`, always pulling in the latest version that now no longer supports Py2.  I realize it's a long shot, but would it be possible to release a patch for 2.2 with an upper bound for the `decorator` dependency? ``` decorator>=4.4 decorator>=4.4,<5; python_version<'3' ```
