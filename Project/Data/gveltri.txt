Add Weighted Graph Support for Semi-Syncronous Label Propagation#TITLE_END#Hey, I've been using a modified version of the NetworkX SSLP that takes into account edge weights and multiple edges.  Currently,[ _most_frequent_labels](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/community/label_propagation.py#L174) works roughly like so:  ``` Take node a. Get all neighbors N of a. For label in labels of N:     Frequency of label = length(n for n in N if label(n) == label) Return labels with the highest frequency. ```  It can be modified to sum up the edge weights like so:  ``` Take node a. Get all neighbors N of a. For label in labels of N:     Weighted sum of label = sum(weight(n) for n in N if label(n) == label) Return labels with the highest weighted sum. ```  If the graph is unweighted, then the sum of weights is equal to the length of nodes. This is already implemented in the Asynchronous Version of this algorithm, so it's simply a matter of copying it over and adding a parameter to label_propagation_communities(G). I'd be happy to submit a PR on this unless there was a specific reason it was omitted.
