make return value of minimum_st_node_cut consistently a set#TITLE_END#Fixes #3846   As given in the issue description, replaced the list with set and changed the test that was expecting a list to make it expect a set. Please review and tell if anything else is to be done.
issue
Fix issue 3431: Return error in case of bad input to make_small_graph#TITLE_END#Fixes #3431   Checked that `ltype` was either **adjacencylist/edgelist**, else raised an error. Also added a tiny test for the same. Also refractored a single line in the test file as it was too long as per *pycodestyle*.  Please let me know if something else needs to be modified.

Fixes issue 3610: Bug in version attribute of gexf.py#TITLE_END#Fixes #3610   Changed the ```self.version``` snippet to ```self.VERSION``` as required. Also added quite a few tests to increase the code coverage of the module to 89%.  ![cov](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25523604/66945144-2c302e00-f06c-11e9-8856-807baaaf7fed.PNG)  Specific tests for slices are included in the PR, as noted in the discussion.  ![cov2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25523604/66945148-2cc8c480-f06c-11e9-8cee-d60d194ba6cc.PNG)  Removed a few linting errors too, as reported by ```pycodestyle```  ![proof3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25523604/66945243-52ee6480-f06c-11e9-950e-42e655ef88bb.PNG)   Please mention whether something else needs to be done for this PR 😄 
issue
Possible bug in version attribute in GEXF.py#TITLE_END#In ```gexf.py```, from lines 769 to 773, we currently have https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/4a0f42b477e5b20377ba7502de555b67b429adc3/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py#L769-L773  while in lines 822-830, it is:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/4a0f42b477e5b20377ba7502de555b67b429adc3/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py#L822-L830  which seemed somewhat inconsistent to me (**version** vs **VERSION**). So I looked above, and found:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/4a0f42b477e5b20377ba7502de555b67b429adc3/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py#L159-L161  which indicates that the ```version``` parameter would only accept ```1.1draft/1.2draft```, while the ```VERSION``` parameter will have ```1.1/1.2``` in it.   https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/4a0f42b477e5b20377ba7502de555b67b429adc3/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py#L250-L251 Hence, the checks in both add_edges and add_nodes with ```self.version``` fails always.  **How to test?**  ```python import networkx as nx G=nx.Graph() G.add_node(0, label='1', color='green') G.nodes[0]['viz']['color'] = {'r' : 0, 'g' : 0, 'b' : 256} fh = io.BytesIO() nx.write_gexf(G, fh, version='1.1draft') fh.seek(0) H = nx.read_gexf(fh, node_type=int) ``` The above code will execute fine, but as soon as we omit the version parameter (which defaults to 1.2draft), it raises the exception as it expects a ```rgba``` tuple. Clearly, the VERSION parameter is working.  However:  ```python import networkx as nx G=nx.Graph() G.add_node(0, label='1', color='green', version='1.1draft') G.nodes[0]['spells']=[(1,2)] print("\n".join(nx.generate_gexf(G))) ``` will still have the spell attribute, but neither will have slice. Same for version=1.2draft (can be checked via **print()** in them too)  Thus, I believe that all the ```self.version = 1.1 ``` checks should be made into ```self.VERSION = 1.1 ```, unless I am misunderstanding it? At any case, the code should be consistent for the check.  **Additional context:** I am currently working on a PR to improve the code coverage of test_gexf.py as per discussion in #3606 and noticed this weird issue. Clarification regarding this bug(?) will be welcome so that I could incorporate it in my PR

Please find a sample execution before and after the changes  **Note** : The recommended solution in the thread (using *try-except* blocks) failed in **windows 10 1903, python 3.7.4** and it seems to be an issue with networkx itself as other `AttributeError` conditions are caught by python just fine. Hence, I went with the method of detecting versions, which solves it without any such problems. 😄   Do let me know if this idea is intractable for some reason.

Replaced is with == and minor pycodestyle fixes#TITLE_END#Fixes issue #3605 .  Also made minor code changes (primarily, changing the lines ```python except: ``` to ```python except Exception as e: ``` and some length trimming to satisfy **pycodestyle**. As I understood from my previous PR, it's appreciated if **pycodestyle** cleanup is done.  ![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25523604/65814751-7b203b80-e203-11e9-9e0d-abf4022844d4.PNG)   Please have a look at it and let me know if it wasn't necessary to make it **pycodestyle** compliant, in which case I would gladly revert the changes 😄

Fixes #3573:GEXF output problem#TITLE_END#This fixes issue #3573 . As discussed in PR #3595, this is a PR that conforms to the best practices and passes the test for python 3.8. Please review and comment as necessary.  **Note**: A test for INF, -INF and NaN called test_specials() has been added in tests/test_gexf.py
issue
Solving issue #3573: GEXF Output problem#TITLE_END#As pointed out in issue #3573 , the XML output was not standard. Changed the position of the meta tag to handle that and handled the three cases of **INF**, **-INF** and **NaN** in input. Also corrected the schemalocation parameter.  Added a test for **INF**, **-INF** and **NaN** called test_specials() in tests/test_gexf.py  Please let me know if this helps or I should change something 😄 
comment
Rather than using try-except, can't it be done by *detecting* the python version (using the sys module), and using an **if-else** construct, since exceptions are relatively more expensive?  Also, is this issue still open for grabs? I'd love to make a PR on it then and help out this amazing project 😁 
comment
Sure, that makes sense. Will work on the PR now 😄
