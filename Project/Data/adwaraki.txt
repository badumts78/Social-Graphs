issue
Mismatch between GEXF and GML internal data?#TITLE_END#Hey,       I am not sure if this issue exists (or if it is an issue at all), but I will try to detail it here all the same.   I am building a graph using Networkx and to be uniform in all places, I am not manually adding the nodes. I just add the edges and let Networkx do the nodes automatically for me so that I do not mess up while creating the graph. Hope this is a valid way to do things.  Now, when I write the graph that I have created (by reading the edges from some file that I have), I write it to two output files, one in GEXF and one in GML. Since, I have not added the nodes myself, Networkx uses the edge end points as labels and gives the nodes a unique internal node ID. Failr enough. But should these IDs be uniform when writing to both the files? I see a different ID in the GEXF file and a different ID in the gml file.  Excerpts from both files at the end. The funny part is when it comes to the edges. The GML format encodes the edges using the internal IDs. But since the GEXF format does not use the same internal IDs, do the edges go to the same nodes?? Or are they different?  A look at both the files should point to what I am talking about.  GML file:  graph [   node [     id 0     label "24"   ]    node [     id 75     label "19"   ] .... and many other nodes  edge [     source 0     target 75     weight 4   ]  GEXF File: (omitted the tags for posting it)  node id="0" label="0" node id="24" label="24" node id="19" label="19" node id="75" label="75" edge id="0" source="24" target="19" weight="4">  As you can see here, we are talking about the same edge in both cases. In the GML file, you can clearly see if mapped from Node Labels 24->19. The GEXF file also says the same thing, but since the IDs and the Labels are not consistent with the GML file, which set of nodes are we talking about here?
