Loading DOT string with pydot subsystem: get_strict() fails#TITLE_END#When creating a networkx graph from a DOT string, get_strict() fails. This happens when using both methods -- reading the DOT string directly with networkx or creating a pydot graph first and then try to convert.    ### Current Behavior  ```python > TypeError: Graph.get_strict() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given ```  ### Expected Behavior  DOT string is loaded into a networkx Graph instance without throwing errors.   ### Steps to Reproduce  Two ways to reproduce  ```python import networkx import pydot  a = 'digraph my_graph {  a[label="Foo",prop="no"];  b[shape=circle]; a -> b [label="leb"]}' f = io.StringIO(a) g = networkx.nx_pydot.read_dot(f)  > TypeError: Graph.get_strict() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given ``` or  ```python a = 'strict digraph my_graph {  a[label="Foo",prop="no"];  b[shape=circle]; a -> b [label="leb"]}' b = pydot.graph_from_dot_data(a) networkx.nx_pydot.from_pydot(b)  > TypeError: Graph.get_strict() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python==3.11.11 NetworkX==3.5rc0 pydot==4.0.0  ### Additional context  None
