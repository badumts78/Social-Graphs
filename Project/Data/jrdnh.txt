Full test coverage for maxflow in issue #6029#TITLE_END#Increase test coverage for `maxflow` to full * Changed typo that created empty sets of `interface_funcs` and `all_funcs` * Removed unused parameter from `compare_flow_and_cuts` helper function (but left argument values with solutions as comments for reference) * Removed conditional statement from `maxflow.py` that always evaluates to `True`  Fixes #6029

Looks like this has been open for a while, submitted a request https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6355 which I think covers it. There are three short changes summarized below. * A number of tests were being run on empty sets of `interface_funcs` and `all_funcs`. Changed the definitions of these sets from the `&` intersection operator to `|` union operator which I think is what was intended so that they now contain the correct elements. * Removed the `solnFlows` parameter in the helper function `compare_flows_and_cuts` which was never used in the body of the function (the `solnValue` parameter holds the solutions actually used in the body). I left the values that were passed as `solnFlows` as comments for reference. These comments could be removed though. * Removed the conditional statement `if cutset is not None:` that was in line 462 of `maxflows.py`. `cutset` is the result of a list comprehension. An empty list is not `None`, so I don't think this conditional would ever be `False`. Removed to resolve full test coverage.

Hi @dennxa I submitted a request #6355 that fixed the original test coverage issue. rossbar had some additional notes on updating the `solnFlows` parameter in the test helper function (see rossbar's Jan 21 comments in the pull request). I hadn't been able to figure out/had time to find a fix for the `solnFlows` parameter. Would suggest taking a look at #6355 and hopefully you can pick up on the remaining `solnFlows` issue!
