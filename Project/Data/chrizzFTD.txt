pydot - Remove Colon Check on Strings#TITLE_END#Hi NetowrkX team,  Looking at recent work to [re-introduce support for `pydot-3`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7204) (thanks for that!), I was wondering whether removing the check for colons on strings is feasible.  Given that quoting issues like https://github.com/pydot/pydot/issues/258 (which is the one linked to on the check introduced on https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5667) have been addressed on https://github.com/pydot/pydot/pull/363. Issues like https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4663 are no longer an issue with these recent updates by the `pydot` team.  These and similar are valid now: ```python import networkx as nx from networkx.drawing.nx_pydot import to_pydot  G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_node("1.2", style='filled', fillcolor="red:yellow") pydt = to_pydot(G) print(pydt) pydt.write("x.png", prog="dot", format='png') ``` and ```python nodes_info = {     1: dict(         label="{<0>x:y:z|<1>z}",         tooltip=r"Stack:&#10;0: x:y:z&#10;1: b:\...\z.ext&#10;2: b:\...\z.ext",         style='"rounded,filled"',         shape="record",     ),     2: dict(         label="{<0>a|<1>b}",         tooltip=r"Stack:&#10;0: b:\...\a.ext&#10;1: b:\...\b.ext",         style='"rounded,filled"',         shape="record",     ), } edges_info = (     (1, 1, dict(color='"sienna:crimson:orange"')),     (1, 2, dict(color='crimson')), ) import networkx as nx graph = nx.MultiDiGraph() graph.add_nodes_from(nodes_info.items()) graph.add_edges_from(edges_info)  import tempfile fd, fp = tempfile.mkstemp()  from networkx.drawing import nx_pydot nx_pydot.write_dot(graph, fp) print(f"Written to {fp}") ```  Please let me know your thoughts!   FYI @ferdnyc and @lkk7 in case of any suggestions 😄

Pydot - Valid Labels and Tooltips With Colon ( ":" ) Fail Since Networkx-2.8.4#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion --> Hello networkx team,  Thanks for this project!  Recent updates like those from https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5710, `Catch ':' explicitly while working with pydot`, seem to be too aggressive as previous valid code like this started failing since `networkx==2.8.4`:  ```python nodes_info = {     1: dict(         label="{<0>x:y:z|<1>z}",         tooltip=r"Stack:&#10;0: x:y:z&#10;1: b:\...\z.ext&#10;2: b:\...\z.ext",         style='"rounded,filled"',         shape="record",     ),     2: dict(         label="{<0>a|<1>b}",         tooltip=r"Stack:&#10;0: b:\...\a.ext&#10;1: b:\...\b.ext",         style='"rounded,filled"',         shape="record",     ), } edges_info = (     (1, 1, dict(color='"sienna:crimson:orange"')),     (1, 2, dict(color='crimson')), ) import networkx as nx graph = nx.MultiDiGraph() graph.add_nodes_from(nodes_info.items()) graph.add_edges_from(edges_info)  import tempfile fd, fp = tempfile.mkstemp()  from networkx.drawing import nx_pydot nx_pydot.write_dot(graph, fp) print(f"Written to {fp}") ```  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  Running the above code snippet fails with versions after `networkx==2.8.3` (tested with`2.8.4` and `2.8.6`): ```bash (py310usd2208) C:\Users\Christian>python -m pip install networkx==2.8.4 Collecting networkx==2.8.4   Using cached networkx-2.8.4-py3-none-any.whl (2.0 MB) Installing collected packages: networkx Successfully installed networkx-2.8.4  (py310usd2208) C:\Users\Christian>python B:\write\code\git\grillbkp\network_broken.py Traceback (most recent call last):   File "B:\write\code\git\grillbkp\network_broken.py", line 28, in <module>     nx_pydot.write_dot(graph, fp)   File "C:\Users\Christian\.conda\envs\py310usd2208\lib\site-packages\networkx\utils\decorators.py", line 845, in func     return argmap._lazy_compile(__wrapper)(*args, **kwargs)   File "<class 'networkx.utils.decorators.argmap'> compilation 5", line 5, in argmap_write_dot_1   File "C:\Users\Christian\.conda\envs\py310usd2208\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_pydot.py", line 51, in write_dot     P = to_pydot(G)   File "C:\Users\Christian\.conda\envs\py310usd2208\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_pydot.py", line 263, in to_pydot     raise ValueError( ValueError: Node names and attributes should not contain ":" unless they are quoted with "".

Kind regards,
