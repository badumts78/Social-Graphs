IDA* algorithm implementation#TITLE_END#IDA* algorithm implementation for networkx. It works with directed and undirected graphs and heuristics in a similar way to the A* algorithm.   This algorithm works by creating a threshold for each iteration and analysing the nodes that have the minimum heuristic cost below the threshold value (if there's none below the threshold, it expands the less expensive one above that value).   The algorithm works with a recursive search function which proved to be faster rather then an infinite cycle function. The search function analyses the node against the threshold and later it's neighbours to expand the most promising one. Also keeps track of the optimal path explored nodes only releasing the ones it finds not fit, this makes it lighter on memory in comparison to A*.
