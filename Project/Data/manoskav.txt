issue
networkx.algorithms.simple_paths.all_simple_paths function cutoff parameter and returned paths#TITLE_END#Hello,  I would like to point 2 things about the all_simple_paths function: 1) By the definition of simple paths, the function should not return cyclic paths, that is paths from one node to itself. 2) Please update the documentation to state explicitly that the function **by default** searches for paths with cutoff=(number of nodes in graph -1). You must inspect the source code in order to find that, which may lead, as in my case, to a couple of hours of debugging.  Thanks for your time and sorry if this issue is unimportant to be posted here.
