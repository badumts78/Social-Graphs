drawing module silently ignores superfluous **kwds#TITLE_END#The drawing methods defined in [`networkx.drawing.nx_pylab`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py) all define `**kwds` to grab keyword arguments. While `**kwds` that are passed to the `draw` function are passed on (e.g. to `draw_networkx_edges`), they end up not being handled at all: `draw_networkx_edges` and `draw_networkx_nodes` make no use of `**kwds`.  In my opinion, this can be problematic for the following reasons: 1. Unexpected additional keyword arguments can end up not having an effect    - They do not raise an exception either, which would help a user to find out about the wrong argument name    - Example: passing `cmap` to `draw_networkx_edges` instead of the expected `edge_cmap` just ignores `cmap` 2. Lost opportunity: `**kwds` could be passed on to the matplotlib plotting function    - Given that many of the `draw_networkx_edges`/`draw_networkx_nodes` end up in matplotlib functions anyway, this would not be unexpected, imo.  ### Proposal Adjust the `draw` functions such that superfluous `**kwds` are *not* ignored but either have some purpose or raise an error.  Three possibilities to achieve that come to my mind:  1. Still allow `**kwds`, but check for unexpected keys in the `kwds` dict and raise an informative error 2. or: Don't allow `**kwds` in `draw_networkx_edges`/`draw_networkx_nodes`, which would raise a `TypeError` due to passing an unexpected argument 3. or: Pass on `**kwds` to the `LineCollection` or `ax.scatter`, respectively, thus letting matplotlib handle any additional keyword arguments and the error message (which they already do)  Does this make sense? Is there something I'm missing?   If this is a suitable proposal, I would be happy to open a PR for it.
