Clarify the meaning of the cutoff parameter in some path-finding functions#TITLE_END### Motivation  While I was working with `all_simple_paths()`, I got confused about the `cutoff` parameter. The [current description for this parameter](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.simple_paths.all_simple_paths.html) is  ``` cutoff : integer, optional     Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned. ```  How "length" is defined here is ambiguous; my initial guess was that it was in terms of the number of nodes on the path, but it turns out that it's in terms of edges. (So the path `[0, 1]` has length 1, the path `[0, 1, 2]` has length 2, etc.) I imagine other people will also be confused and make the same mistake.  ## Changes  - I updated the docstrings for the following eight functions:   - `all_simple_paths()`   - `all_simple_edge_paths()`   - `all_pairs_shortest_path_length()`   - `single_source_shortest_path_length()`   - `single_target_shortest_path_length()`   - `all_pairs_shortest_path()`   - `single_source_shortest_path()`   - `single_target_shortest_path()`    to clarify the meaning of `cutoff`. I think the adjusted documentation is easier to understand.  - I fixed a small error in the documentation of `single_target_shortest_path()` -- it said `keyed by target` where it should, I think, have said `keyed by source`.  - Some of the above functions' docstrings (e.g. [`all_pairs_shortest_path()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.unweighted.all_pairs_shortest_path.html)) say "`cutoff`" (escaping the parameter name, when referenced, in backticks) while some don't (just saying "cutoff"—e.g. [`single_source_shortest_path()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.unweighted.single_source_shortest_path.html)). To make this consistent, I changed the above functions' docstrings—where needed—to say "`cutoff`" instead of "cutoff".  - ~~I fixed a small bug that I noticed in `predecessor()`.~~ → update: per discussion below, not addressing in this PR.   - **Description:** The functions that have a `cutoff` parameter explicitly check if `cutoff is None` and adjust their behavior accordingly. However, `predecessor()` does not do this -- instead, it checks the truth value of `cutoff`. This will have (I think) undesirable results if `cutoff == 0`, since `cutoff == 0` will be treated the same as `cutoff == None`. (Not that I imagine a lot of people will be calling this function with a cutoff of 0, but I suppose consistency here is nice.)   - **Fix:** I've replaced the use of `if cutoff` in this function with `if cutoff is not None` to fix this problem.  ## Notes  `predecessor()` also has a `cutoff` parameter, but I haven't updated its documentation (even though it has the same issue of not explaining what the cutoff "length" means). I'm not completely sure what this function is doing, and I don't want to add incorrect documentation to it by accident.
