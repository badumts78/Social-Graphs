vertex-cover: Added support for self-loop edges and improved performance#TITLE_END#The vertex_cover algorithm updated the cost of u,v twice in case node v and node u are the same nodes. As a result self-edges nodes are overlooked. Here we fixed the cost map upating to occur only once if v==u.  #5103

Why do networkx's approximations for vertex cover not include self-loop nodes?#TITLE_END#In networkx docs we define vertex cover as follows: > A vertex cover is a subset of nodes such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one node in the subset.   ### Current Behavior The returned vertex cover set lacks the self-connected nodes. for this graph: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553010/134812281-e7ec79a1-7fcf-4782-a01f-af7bb4434037.png)  the found vertex cover will be `{0}` which omits nodes `1` and `2`  ### Expected Behavior I would expect it to consider self-connected loops or at least have a parameter so the caller will decide what is the desired behavior.  ### Steps to Reproduce ~~~python import networkx from networkx.algorithms.approximation import vertex_cover, min_weighted_dominating_set import numpy as np  r=np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(1,5), p=[0.6, 0.4]) a=r.T*r np.fill_diagonal(a, 1)  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.figure(figsize=(3, 3), dpi=100)  G = networkx.from_numpy_array(a) networkx.draw(G,pos=networkx.random_layout(G),font_size=8, with_labels=True) plt.show()  print(vertex_cover.min_weighted_vertex_cover(G)) ~~~  ### Environment  Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.6.2   ### Additional context N/A
