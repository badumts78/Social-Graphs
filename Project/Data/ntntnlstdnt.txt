issue
Accessing node attribute from update Graph#TITLE_END#Hello,   I am having issues accessing attributes from a node that I updated using the set node attribute method. Below, is the exact that I ran to add the attribute to my node:   `nx.set_node_attributes(G, {1: 1}, 'value')`  I ran `G.nodes(data=True)` to confirm update, output is `NodeDataView({1: {'value': 1}})`, but when I try to access the attribute using `G[1]['value']` it raise a `KeyError`. So I ran `G[1]` that outputs `AtlasView({})`, which I assume show that the `AtlasView` didn't receive the update.   So is there an alternative way to get the node attribute's value OR a step to update to update the `AtlasView` as well?
