issue
`omega` gives values that are not within [-1,1] bounds#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  According to the paper this metric has been based upon, [found here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604768/) , omega needs to be between [-1,1].  However nx.omega gives as a result many values that are not within [-1,1] bounds  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  values not being within the expected [-1,1] bounds  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  values should be within [-1,1] bounds  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.barbell_graph(5,1) print(nx.omega(G,seed=1)) # result is -1.505815972222222 ``` ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.7.4 NetworkX version: 2.5.1   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
