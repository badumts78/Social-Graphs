issue
Install Networkx 2.8 in colab#TITLE_END#I have tried to install networkx in colab. I need the latest version 2.8 or at least 2.7, since I want to use the louvain_communities.  If I use the standard example: ``` import networkx as nx from networkx.algorithms import community G = nx.petersen_graph() community.louvain_communities(G, seed=123) ``` I get:  `AttributeError: module 'networkx.algorithms.community' has no attribute 'louvain_communities'`  Thus I tried: ```  ! pip uninstall networkx !pip install imgaug==0.2.6 !pip install  networkx>=2.7 import networkx as nx nx.__version__ ``` which just allow me to install networkx 2.6.3  Or I tried:  `!pip install git+https://github.com/networkx/networkx.git --verbose`  which it does not work (with other packages) worked.  Do you have some suggestions?  Thanks for help
