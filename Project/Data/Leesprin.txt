A* (A star) function astar_path returns a wrong answer#TITLE_END#Suppose we have a graph below: ![astarexample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51309106/58777405-b8cbd980-8600-11e9-9630-166c665db555.png) Find shortest path from N5 to N0. Numbers in bracket alongside each node are heuristic values estimating distance to n0. (This is a bad example of heuristic function I constructed to use in my classroom.) The best path from n5 to n0 is:   n5→n4→n3→n2→n1→n0 What networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar.astar_path returns:  [n5, n1, n0]  which is apparently not correct.
