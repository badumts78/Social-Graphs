D star lite algorithm implementation#TITLE_END#### *The implementation of the D Star Lite algorithm*  The D* Lite (Dynamic A* Lite) algorithm is a sophisticated path planning technique employed in dynamic environments, where knowledge about the map can be subject to alteration during agent execution. It is an efficient variation of the A* algorithm, which allows incremental replanning of the optimal path. That is to say, the algorithm avoids recalculating the path from scratch whenever there is a change in the environment.   The D* Lite algorithm finds application in the following areas:  -> Mobile robotics (e.g. drones or autonomous vehicles); -> Games and simulations with interactive environments; -> Real-time evacuation or routing systems.   The implementation of this algorithm is undertaken as part of a university assignment, in conjunction with pull requests #7970, #7969, and #7965.  The integration of this code into the A-Star code is a subject of uncertainty. This is the first occasion on which I am contributing to this project, and I am awaiting a review from a more senior member of the team. I would like to express my gratitude for your attention.
