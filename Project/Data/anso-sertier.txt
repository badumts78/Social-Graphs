issue
Subgraph isomorphism#TITLE_END#Hello,  I'm working on detection of subgraph isomorphism with : GM.subgraph_isomorphisms_iter() function. In a working example, my G1 should be isomorphic to G2 and the function return nothing. I take a look at the code and made some print to understand. And finally, the printing inside the match() function from GraphMatcher class return an error on line 71 of _semantic_feasibility function in vf2userfunc.py).  File "/home/anneso/myroot/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx-1.11-py2.7.egg/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/vf2userfunc.py", line 71, in _semantic_feasibility     G2_adj[G2_node][core_1[neighbor]]): KeyError: 'AB2a'  I don't know if I'm right or not, but if I understand well, the edge en G2 (between G2_node and core_1[neighbor]) might not exist, by construction the edge G1_node/neighbor exists but in G2, this edge could not exist and thus return a KeyError that stop all the current process (the match() function return nothing). Am I write ?  Thanks in advance.
