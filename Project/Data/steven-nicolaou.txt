simple_cycles infinite loop#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior `simple_cycles` appears to enter an infinite loop. My graph has under 4000 nodes and edges. If I subtract a handful of them (less than 100), it runs successfully in just about a minute. I could not reduce it to a minimal example, so I have hashed the nodes and attached the smallest example that I could reproduce it with. It does not seem to be just a matter of a large number of cycles.  ### Expected Behavior `simple_cycles` returns a list of cycles  ### Steps to Reproduce g1: Graph that triggers infinite loop g2: Graph with some edges removed that runs successfully  ``` # Load Graph 1 g1 = nx.adjacency_graph(json.load(open('g1.json'))) cycles = nx.simple_cycles(g1) # ← Infinite loop  # Load Graph 2 g2 = nx.adjacency_graph(json.load(open('g2.json'))) cycles = nx.simple_cycles(g2) # ← Runs in about 1 minute ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.9.12 NetworkX version: 2.8.7  ### Additional context The 2 graphs in JSON format [graphs.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/9770299/graphs.zip)
