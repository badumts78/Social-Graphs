issue
networkx missing modules when installed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS#TITLE_END#to replicate the issue: 1. `python3.7 -m pip install networkx`  2. write a python file (in this case, network_testing.py) with just the line `import networkx as nx`.  The error that pops up is this: `Traceback (most recent call last):   File "network_testing.py", line 2, in <module>     import networkx as nx   File "/home/username/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/__init__.py", line 98, in <module>     import networkx.utils ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'networkx.utils'`  I looked into the location of the networkx package and found that the only module it had was `algorithms.`
