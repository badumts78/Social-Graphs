Wrong Dominance Frontiers when loop in first 2 nodes#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  Currently when having a graph where there is a loop from the first node outgoing and the loop contains 2 nodes like in the following case:  Start node: 1  Edges: 1-2 2-1 2-3  ![image](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/43956528/e17d40c9-fc0c-4f19-8331-b485edc5caa1)  The result of the dominance_frontiers is {1: set(), 2: set(), 3: set()}   ### Expected Behavior  I would expect the result {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: set()}   ### Steps to Reproduce  A graph like with edges shown above. In my case i have a bigger implementation where the graph is internally generated.  ### Solution approach  In the function dominance_frontiers changing the code from:      idom = nx.immediate_dominators(G, start)      df = {u: set() for u in idom}     for u in idom:         if len(G.pred[u]) >= 2:             for v in G.pred[u]:                 if v in idom:                     while v != idom[u]:                         df[v].add(u)                         v = idom[v]     return df to      idom = nx.immediate_dominators(G, start)      df = {u: set() for u in idom}     for u in idom:         if len(G.pred[u]) >= 2 or (len(G.pred[u]) >= 1 and u == start):             for v in G.pred[u]:                 if v in idom:                     while v != idom[u]:                         df[v].add(u)                         v = idom[v]     return df  "or (len(G.pred[u]) >= 1 and u == start)" will lead to the case that the start node will also be looked at. Because it has a non existing entry edge and therefore also one predecessor is enough for DF changes. Could also be simply "or u == start" This results in {1: set(), 2: 1, 3: set()} still missing the 1:1.  When now also changing the idom implementation as in [#6710](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6710) so that it starts with {start: None} the result would be the expected one.

A graphs start node is its own Immediate-Dominator in your implementation which should not be the case#TITLE_END#The function immediate_dominators currently returns a result where the start node is its own idom. By definition the starting node of a graph is the only node without any immediate dominator.  Maybe i am wrong but it would be nice if your could change the behaviour of this function to be according to the definition of i-dom. "Every node, except the entry node, has an immediate dominator."
