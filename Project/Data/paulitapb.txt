issue
Fix doc inconsistencies related to cutoff in connectivity.py and disjoint_paths.py#TITLE_END#In `local_edge_connectivity` and `local_node_connectivity` from **connectivity.py** the cutoff description implies that only `edmonds_karp()` and `shortest_augmenting_path()` support cutoff. That is not true. Now those algorithms are given as examples of flow functions that allow cutoff. I tried to keep the description as general as possible and reference to [Flow](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/flow.html) as the source of truth so in the future, if new flow algorithms are added there's no need to change this.  Also changed the cutoff description in `edge_connectivity` from **connectivity.py** to match `local_edge_connectivity` and `local_node_connectivity` cutoff description.  Finally in **disjoint_paths.py** added a reference to [Flow](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/flow.html) in the cutoff description of `node_disjoint_paths `and `edge_disjoint_paths`. 
issue
issue #6081: allow cutoff functionality for flow functions#TITLE_END#In maxflow.py, I changed ``` flow_funcs ``` to ``` flow_funcs_without_cutoff  ``` and also updated the flow functions that support *cutoff*.

bug fix in smallworld.py: random_reference and lattice_reference#TITLE_END#Closes #6150.   Changed random_reference, and lattice_reference, now an exception is raised if the function is called with a graph with fewer than 2 edges. Also updated the documentation.

Broken link in isomorphism documentation#TITLE_END#As I was reading the documentation I found that the link in the reference section of `is_isomorphic` is broken. I replaced the current link with a new version but I'm not sure if it's the right one.  The paper seems to be the same. Maybe the citation format is not right.  
issue
In smallworld.py: ZeroDivisionError when passing a graph without edges#TITLE_END#This is a similar error to #6144 that comes from the use of `nx.utils.cumulative_distribution` with graphs without edges. In #6144 there is a deeper explanation of the bug.  
issue
Bug fix in swap: directed_edge_swap and double_edge_swap #TITLE_END#Closes #6144  Changed directed_edge_swap, now an exception is raised if the number of edges is less than 3. Also updated the documentation.  Changed `double_edge_swap`, now an exception is raised when the function is called with a graph with fewer than 2 edges. Added some tests and updated the documentation to include a raises section that was missing.  
issue
directed_edge_swap: ZeroDivisionError when passing a digraph without edges#TITLE_END#I was working on improving test coverage for `swap.py` and tested `directed_edge_swap` with a digraph without edges. That resulted in a ZeroDivisionError from `nx.utils.cumulative_distribution`.   ### Steps to Reproduce  ```python from networkx as nx  G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_nodes_from([0, 2, 4, 3])  G = nx.directed_edge_swap(G, nswap=1, max_tries=500, seed=1) ``` ### Current Behavior  ZeroDivisionError is raised because in `nx.utils.cumulative_distribution` there's a division by the sum of the input distribution that is zero. The distribution that `nx.utils.cumulative_distribution` is called with in this example is the degrees of a digraph without edges (all degrees are zero). This is the error log.   ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "test.py", line 12, in <module>     G = nx.directed_edge_swap(G, nswap=1, max_tries=500, seed=1)   File "/home/paula/Outreachy/networkX/networkx/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 766, in func     return argmap._lazy_compile(__wrapper)(*args, **kwargs)   File "<class 'networkx.utils.decorators.argmap'> compilation 21", line 5, in argmap_directed_edge_swap_17   File "/home/paula/Outreachy/networkX/networkx/networkx/algorithms/swap.py", line 81, in directed_edge_swap     cdf = nx.utils.cumulative_distribution(degrees)  # cdf of degree   File "/home/paula/Outreachy/networkX/networkx/networkx/utils/random_sequence.py", line 103, in cumulative_distribution     cdf.append(cdf[i] + distribution[i] / psum) ZeroDivisionError: division by zero ``` ### Expected Behavior  I think the best is to raise an exception in `directed_edge_swap` with a message that exposes this situation.  Also, this should be added to the [doc entry](https://output.circle-artifacts.com/output/job/ab098af6-f76c-4bf9-a732-5c243aca96da/artifacts/0/doc/build/html/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.swap.directed_edge_swap.html#directed-edge-swap).   ### Environment  Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.8.7  ### Further Discoveries  Something else that should be added is that if the digraph has less than 3 edges then is impossible to swap edges. In that case, the current behavior is that the max number of tries is reached. In my opinion, this case should raise an exception with an appropriate message. Also, this could be mentioned in the  [doc entry](https://output.circle-artifacts.com/output/job/ab098af6-f76c-4bf9-a732-5c243aca96da/artifacts/0/doc/build/html/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.swap.directed_edge_swap.html#directed-edge-swap).   I will work on these changes and will look closely at the other functions in `swap.py`.  Also, I think it will be good to review the functions that use `nx.utils.cumulative_distribution` to check for this error. I can do that too.

comment
Hi, I could replicate your problem. How did you select which nodes to subtract?
comment
ok! I was looking at the algorithm cover test and there's one if-condition branch that was not tested. I will see if that's where the problem occurs.
comment
good point! I think that may be the problem. Because for g2 the number of simple cycles is 89113 which is not much compared with the worst case for a graph of 3587 nodes. And as @steven-nicolaou chose the number of nodes and edges randomly it's very likely that g1 is a graph with too many simple cycles. 
comment
This sometimes happens with the artifacts that run the tests. Maybe there was another push and the artifacts canceled the tests in your PR to run tests on another PR. Don't worry about it. When someone from NetworkX reviews your PR they can rerun the tests. 
comment
Generally LGTM! I would add a note about installing the specific doc requirements first. 
comment
The function is still in aproximation. I reproduced this with networkX 2.8.7 and Python 3.8 but didn't get that error. Are you using a virtualenv? If helps I also tested networkX 2.6.3 and It works. 
comment
Working on this! Already made a pull request!
comment
I think the problem is that cutoff for shortest_augmenting_path is not working properly that's why is disabled even when the function does allow the argument. 
comment
I'll do it 
comment
this is the PR that correct the list of functions that don't allow cutoff: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6085
comment
I checked connectivity.py and `local_edge_connectivity` is using `edmonds_karp` if flow_func is None. Then when `maximum_flow_value` is called _flow_func_ is `edmonds_karp` because that is passed through _**kwargs_ argument.  I did a simple experiment and I confirmed that. I also checked the doc page and It seems that we should correct that only edmonds_karp and shortest_augmenting_path support _cutoff_. I'll do that later. Also, I will read the doc page for related functions that may have the same inconsistency. Should I open a new issue for this @dschult ?
comment
perfect!
