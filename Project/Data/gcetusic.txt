NetworkX logo proposal#TITLE_END#After several years of development, networkx still doesn't have a logo as commented in #1170. After playing with a logo idea and a somewhat positive reaction on the  GSOC gitter page, I've decided to propose at least a temporary logo and open a discussion. Here is the proposed logo: https://github.com/gcetusic/gcetusic.github.io/blob/master/images/networkx3.svg. Variations of this are the other networkx*.svg files. ![networkx3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1023690/6686517/861f2f62-cca2-11e4-9c61-ce1bea18a42f.png)  I know it's not the most exciting thing to do on a project but I think it's worthwhile to spend a little effort to make a logo so please voice your opinion.

Pep8#TITLE_END#For programmers that use linter tools in their editors, code that  doesn't conform to PEP8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) tends to become somewhat obtrusive. A perfect example is SublimeLinter. In any case, Python code should conform to PEP8 and NetworkX lacks this in some parts of its code. This PR more or less fixes this in base classes (classes folder). Any changes to other parts of the code should also incorporate pep8 style fixes around the area that's being edited.

Hello, it's me again. I don't know if you've looked into https://github.com/espeed/bulbs. It's a good reference for support of multiple graph databases. And https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-python/blob/master/stormpath/cache/cache.py has a nice pattern for various data storages

Regarding GSOC, I've written a proposal page for the NetworkX gui, first mentioned in #1326. I didn't get any feedback on it there so please let me know what you think. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/wiki/NetworkX-GUI---GSOC-2015-proposal  Also +1 to @MridulS for the IRC idea 
comment
@RONNCC I didn't want to spend more time on it if the idea in general is going to be considered off-topic. I asked if the idea is feasible in #1326 with no answer (so far) so I wrote the proposal anyway and @chebee7i was the first one to give a constructive criticism but hinted that although the GUI is a nice idea as a Python project, the proposal might be rejected because NetworkX was leaning towards removing any GUI parts anyway. I responded with some explanations why I still consider it a good idea. Generally, I'd really like to work on NetworkX during this summer since I'm an ICT student and it's my last year so please let me know what you think of the proposal so far. I'm planning to make another proposal for the alternative backend. 
comment
@MridulS I'm not really that familiar with NetworkX code but any kind of access to graph data should be (in the ideal case) in one central location in the code. If that's not already the case then designing an alternative backend is going to be a nightmare and it'll change anyway during the API refactoring so these two are also clearly related as stated on the ideas page. Any ideas how coordinating these separate but related proposals would work? I'm under the impression that Networkx 2.0 should be done before the other proposals. 
comment
Why not just take whatever the svg on the networkx website spits out first and take it as the logo? Take the one end and make it into an N and the other into an X and that's it! 
comment
@Midnighter I've submited my backend proposal: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/student/google/gsoc2015/gcetusic/5707702298738688  It's basically the same one that you reviewed on the wiki page and said it looks good on gitter. That's it from me for now. Best of luck to other students applying :)

Hello! I see you're applying for GSoC 2015 -> https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2015 I'm finishing my master's degree in Telecomunications and Informatics and I'm interested in working on this project. Sorry if this isn't the right place, I can send this via the mailing list. It seemed more appropriate instead of just randomly sending an email to the list. I hope this isn't too much but the advice given to students is to start contacting possible mentors as soon as possible. I've also been a CERN summer student so this would be a great way to finish my education and I can send my CV for you to view further and fill in the application per instructions (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/wiki/GSoC-2015-Application-Template). So here it goes.  Let me just explain why this project is interesting to me and let me know if you're interested in taking me on as a student. I've worked on a lot of Python 2/3 projects and my masters thesis is porting the IMUNES network simulator from FreeBSD to Linux. Basically, you have a sandbox where you create a graph with nodes and edges and then run tiny virtual machines with docker/jails/lxc for nodes and connect them together (http://imunes.tel.fer.hr/) It's a great network tool but it's in Tcl/Tk and they still use SVN and the project itself is somewhat obscure so I started to rewrite it into Tkinter. I've forked the project to github and started working on separate branches, one for linux and the other for python. I've made a skeleton and you can view it here: https://github.com/gcetusic/IMUNES/tree/python_imunes by running imunes.py inside python_imunes directory. It's really just a skeleton but I hope you get the general idea.   So my question is: Would you consider adding a GUI interface for networkX? The idea is to make it abstract enough to run both a full fledged network simulator and networkX. The FreeBSD version does basically the same thing: you can add nodes, modify edge weights, draw all kind of graphs automatically...I encourage you to to try it out, it's for FreeBSD until I port it :) I think it's actually a lot more complex than what networkx needs. Even if you're not interested in this, would you consider me for other ideas like the alternative backend or the 2.0 API? As I said, I have lots of experience in Python and networks and graphs are part of my masters so that won't be a problem.
