issue
Linear prufer coding#TITLE_END#resolves #3521.  I suggest these changes, as the already implemented paper's solution is fine and only a simple fix in networkx' current implementation is required. In contrast, #3523 implements another paper's solution.

Hello,  I ran into the accused function performing quadratically as well. I read the referenced paper and identified the issue, which is in the implementation and not the referenced paper! The problem with the referenced line `index = u = min(k for k in range(index + 1, n) if degree[k] == 1)`  is quite straight forward. It is always the smallest index that satisfies the predicate which should be the result. But `min`, does not stop at the first satisfying index, it unnecessarily scans the remaining indices as well. If this were avoided, every number from `0` to `n-1` would only be considered once in the entire execution of the algorithm, since the index which defines the start of the search range is moved onwards in the same operation. A simple solution is to replace `min` with `next`. The identical line before the loop should be adjusted as well.
