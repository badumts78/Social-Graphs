have dag_longest_path_length return path length, not edge count#TITLE_END#fix for #2229 
issue
don't assume nodes are sortable when running dag_longest_path#TITLE_END#The `dag_longest_path function` can raise an TypeError Exception when the nodes of the DiGraph passed to it aren't sortable (i.e. don't define the `__lt__` method). The algorithm creates a list of `(length, u)` tuples, where u is a node. It then runs the `max()` function on said list. Ordering of tuples is defined by comparing corresponding elements lexicographically. So if ever there's a case where two lengths are equal, the nodes will be compared a `TypeError: unorderable types` is raised. I suspect that this would occur for very frequently when using unsortable nodes considering how the algorithm works. 
issue
dag_longest_path_length doesn't produce what it should for graphs with weighted edges#TITLE_END#I believe the `dag_longest_path_length` function isn't returning what it should in the case where the edges weights aren't all one.  The `dag_longest_path` function returns the path through the DAG where the sum of the weights of all the edges is higher (or equal to) than the same for all other paths. It represents this path as a list of nodes.  The `dag_longest_path_length` function behaves like this:  ``` return len(nx.dag_longest_path(G)) - 1 ```  I would expect this function to return the sum of the weights of the edges on the longest path. More concisely, it should return the length of the longest path. Instead, it's returning the number of edges on the path , not the sum of the weights of the edges on the path. Is this intentional? This isn't what the "longest path problem" generally aims to solve.  If you agree with my interpretation of what it should produce, I can submit a pull request which fixes the behavior of the function.
