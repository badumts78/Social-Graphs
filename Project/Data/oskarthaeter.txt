issue
docstring can be None when calling python with `-OO`#TITLE_END#<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> [networkx/utils/backends.py line 2313](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/c107d25c853fbfe082c12d9e8c77afe4f34e91da/networkx/utils/backends.py#L2313C9-L2313C60) causes an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rstrip'` when running python with the flag [`-OO`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-OO). ### Current Behavior  `return f"{self._orig_doc.rstrip()}\n\n    {to_add}"` raises an AttributeError. ```shell Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/workspaces/bug.py", line 1, in <module>     from networkx.utils.backends import _dispatchable   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/__init__.py", line 22, in <module>     from networkx import classes   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/classes/__init__.py", line 6, in <module>     from .function import *   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/classes/function.py", line 1044, in <module>     def is_negatively_weighted(G, edge=None, weight="weight"):   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/utils/backends.py", line 567, in __new__     self = argmap(_do_nothing)(self)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 793, in __call__     func.__doc__ = f.__doc__   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/utils/backends.py", line 579, in __doc__     rv = self._cached_doc = self._make_doc()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/networkx/utils/backends.py", line 1520, in _make_doc     return f"{self._orig_doc.rstrip()}\n\n    {to_add}" AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rstrip' ```  ### Expected Behavior  Ignore `func.__doc__` when it is None, or set `self._orig_doc` to an empty string.  Alternatively: Just add a disclaimer to not run with -OO flag when using networkx.  ### Steps to Reproduce  bug.py ```python from networkx.utils.backends import _dispatchable ``` Run with `python -OO bug.py`  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 3.3  ### Additional context I am not familiar with networkx. This came up when using pytorch.compile and trying out the -OO flag, which I had never heard of. I am not sure how widespread the use of the flag is or how important it is to support it. Just seems like something to be aware of. In any case, at least this edge case will now be documented for future reference.
