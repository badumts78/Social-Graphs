Verify edges are valid in is_matching()#TITLE_END#Previously the is_matching() function was never checking the edges in the provided matching against the graph, it would just validate there were no shared endpoints. The graph object passed in to the function was never used. This commit updates the function to check that all the edges in the matching are valid and present in the provided graph before checking if the are no shared endpoints.  <!-- Please run black to format your code.
