The problem is in this line:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/acae7c5f771d9646835e34912af79430c147a4a6/networkx/readwrite/nx_shp.py#L221  It indeed assumes the *node* key is also a tuple, even though the comment only mentions edges. It should at least fail gracefully in this case (rather than just erroring trying to index into the key). More useful would be to have options as to what node and/or edge attributes are used to create geometry - e.g. if you already have a `pos` attribute containing position data it would make more sense to use that.

Fair point, it's a bit different compared to how node positions are handled elsewhere (e.g. the pos arg) but ok - threw me a bit but it had been a long day. Could still add a check for the key format to return a slightly clearer error I suppose.   Ended up diving into the code a bit to see about implementing more options and TBH it's probably not worth reworking the whole thing since a better solution is to export the graph data and use either shapely+fiona or GeoPandas to save GIS files (added bonus that its easy to use other formats).
