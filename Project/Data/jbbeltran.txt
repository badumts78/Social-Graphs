issue
Getting TypeError upon calling extrema_bounding(G, compute="eccentricities") in distance_measures.py#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> I tried using the ``extrema_bounding`` function from ``networkx.algorithms.distance_measures`` to compute eccentricity values for all nodes in a Graph. The documentation does not present the "eccentricities" option for the ``compute`` keyword argument but it is available in the source code so I went ahead and tried it. The exact function call I did was ``extrema_bounding(G, compute="eccentricities")``.  Looking at the code, I believe the problem is in lines 152 and 153  ```python ...         elif compute == "eccentricities":             ruled_out = {} ```  I believe the intention is to make ``ruled_out`` an empty set (``set([])``), but ``{}`` is interpreted as an empty dictionary.   ### Current Behavior Outputs a ``TypeError: cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence``  ### Expected Behavior The function should run without errors.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> Running the following snippet should reproduce the bug: ```python from networkx.generators.social import karate_club_graph from networkx.algorithms.distance_measures import extrema_bounding  G = karate_club_graph() ecc = extrema_bounding(G, compute="eccentricities") ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: Python 3.8.1 NetworkX version: networkx 2.7.1
