Write pajek error#TITLE_END#When rewriting a network who has been read from pajek there is an error: 'float' object has no attribute 'strip' apparently coordinates (x,y) don't get translated back to string (Networkx 2.1)
comment
it happens with the "coordinates". actually the function seems to attempt a conversion to string, but x & y don't get converted... 
comment
yes, agree on only writing attributes that are strings.   coordinates: in Pajek the x and y are used to draw the network. they are the coordinates of the nodes in the drawing window, so typically useless when writing from Networkx (in Pajek one would redraw...) 
comment
wuhaochen , actually not totally true. this is ok with pajek (node number and ID only) *Vertices nn   1 "C1"    ...... *Edges (or *Arcs) ....  and even this: *Vertices nn *Edges (or *Arcs)  if you don't give  node IDs Pajek will create (v1,v2,...)
