issue
Add basic support for Jython 2.7b1#TITLE_END#This allows NetworkX to be used from Jython 2.7b1, and closes issue #1026.  The most significant change I introduced is that `generators.atlas` is not imported anymore by default. One can import it manually if they think their interpreter can handle it. This is what was already described in the documentation, anyway, as the docstring for the module said: "Because of its size, this module is not imported by default.", so I don't think anyone will complain about it.  I updated the relevant tests to reflect the change, and set them up so that they are skipped if the testing is being run in Jython. I have to say that many other, unrelated tests still don't pass under Jython, but that's a separate issue. 
issue
Can't import from Jython#TITLE_END#With the latest Jython version (2.7b1; older versions are only compatible with Python <=2.5), if I try to import NetworkX I get the following error:  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "networkx/__init__.py", line 56, in <module>     import networkx.utils   File "networkx/utils/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>     from networkx.utils.misc import *   File "networkx/utils/misc.py", line 22, in <module>     from networkx.external.decorator import decorator   File "networkx/external/decorator/__init__.py", line 6 SyntaxError: 'import *' not allowed with 'from .' ```  And moreover, even if I fix that there are issues with the size of the definition of the `generators.atlas.graph_atlas_g` function being larger than the maximum method size in Java.  I've got what I think it's a sensible solution for this. Pull request incoming.
