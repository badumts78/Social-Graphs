New algorithm for ranking spanning arborescences#TITLE_END#I'd like to contribute by implementing the first algorithm for ranking spanning arborescences (RANK). It's based on [camerini1980ranking]. According to the paper, given a network, RANK computes K most weighted spanning arborescenceos, rooted at a specified node.  The reason for this algorithm is discussed in the paper:  > Given a combinatorial optimization problem P, it may happen that P is too simple a mathematical model of a real problem, so that having at hand a number of alternative solutions is helpful in choosing the most suitable one in the real environment. It may also happen that it is too difficult to incorporate in P some given set of constraints, while it is an easy matter to solve P: in such cases it can be advisable (or even unavoidable) to rank the solutions until one satisfying the extra constraints is found.   As mentioned in the paper, formal proofs can be found in [camerini1980k].  ---  - [camerini1980ranking] Camerini, P. M., Fratta, L., & Maffioli, F. (1980). Ranking arborescences in O (Km log n) time.

New algorithm for ranking spanning arborescences for (#4322)#TITLE_END#I have done:  - Use `black`. - Run all the tests for algorithms and docs locally. - Unit tests for core classes and functions used by these algorithms. - Use decorator for graph type.  As far as I know, there are problems:  - All the edges are supposed to have the specified numerical attribute. - There is only one test case with 5 spanning arborescences. - The passed graph is deep copied and frozen inside the generator, in case it is modified later.
