number_of_edges cannot be computed for empty edges#TITLE_END#Hello guys and gals,  I'm using networkx for simple analysis of parcels on a database and it's a great lib. Congratulations.  Well,  I was building a unit test here and generated a tree with a single node. I tried to assert that the number of nodes would be equal to 1 and number of edges equals 0.  Networkx is giving me the following traceback:  ``` python Error Traceback (most recent call last):   File "E:/PROJETOS/znc/sgf\sgf\historico\tests\arvore.py", line 86, in test_no_forever_alone     self.assertEqual(grafo.number_of_edges(), 0)   File "C:\virtualenvs\sgf\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\graph.py", line 1664, in number_of_edges     if u is None: return int(self.size())   File "C:\virtualenvs\sgf\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\graph.py", line 1627, in size     s=sum(self.degree(weight=weight).values())/2 AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'values' ```  Here's the following unit test:  ``` python     def test_no_forever_alone(self):          """         Testa que um grafo com apenas um nó         só tenha o mesmo no grafo nx         """          pai = no_forever_alone()          grafo = self.j.construir_arvore(pai)          # o networkx dá pala quando testamos number_of_edges e ele é igual a 0         self.assertEqual(grafo.number_of_nodes(), 1)         self.assertEqual(grafo.number_of_edges(), 0)  # <<< exception here ```  The function `no_forever_alone` returns a node of the type I'm looking for and basically, I use Django to create the graph object using the `self.j.construir_arvore` method. Since this node does not have relationship with others, it simply creates a DiGraph and adds the single node to it.  The funny thing is that the `nodes()` and `edges()` method, when counted with `len()` returns me the correct results.  If you need more information, let me know.  The
