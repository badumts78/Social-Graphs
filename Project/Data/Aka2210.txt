DOC: Clarify node and edge removal behavior in tutorial#TITLE_END#This PR updates the “Removing elements from a graph” section to explicitly show how node and edge removals affect the graph structure.  It clarifies that removing a node also removes its incident edges, and replaces the ambiguous list(G) calls with explicit list(G.nodes) and list(G.edges) outputs to display both node and edge states clearly.

ENH: Add is_perfect_graph using SPGT (follow-up to #8111)#TITLE_END#Implements is_perfect_graph(G) based on the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem (SPGT).  The function returns True if and only if neither the graph nor its complement contains an induced odd chordless cycle (odd hole) of length ≥ 5.  This refines and completes the earlier proposal in [#8111](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8111).  The current implementation runs in exponential time in the worst case, while the full SPGT recognition algorithm is polynomial (O(n⁹)) but too intricate to include here.

Deprecate metric_closure#TITLE_END#Following up on [discussion #8294](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/8294)  The metric_closure function currently lives in networkx/algorithms/approximation/steinertree.py, but:  - It is not used by any of the Steiner tree algorithms (originally added for Kou’s algorithm, but later replaced). - Having it under the approximation namespace is misleading, since metric_closure is a general graph transformation (complete graph with shortest-path distances), not an approximation routine. - The same functionality is essentially available via all_pairs_shortest_path_length, so the dedicated function provides limited additional value.  Proposed changes:  - Add a DeprecationWarning to metric_closure. - Add .. deprecated:: directive in the docstring. - Update release notes to mention planned removal in the next major release. - Add a small gallery example to illustrate the “metric closure” terminology and show that it corresponds to computing all-pairs shortest path lengths.

DEP: Deprecate metric_closure#TITLE_END#Deprecates metric_closure in networkx.algorithms.approximation.steinertree.  - Adds DeprecationWarning to metric_closure. - Adds .. deprecated:: 3.5 directive to the docstring. - Adds filter to conftest.py. - Adds entry to doc/developer/deprecations.rst for removal in 3.7.  Replacement: use :func:networkx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length.  Related to #8302

DOC: add gallery example for metric_closure#TITLE_END#This PR updates the new gallery example for the metric closure.  - Clarifies the definition of the metric closure for both weighted and unweighted graphs:   - For weighted graphs, edge weights in the closure correspond to the minimum total     weight along any path between two nodes.   - For unweighted graphs, all edges are assumed to have weight 1, so closure weights     correspond to the minimum number of hops.  - Adjusts the example to demonstrate the *unweighted* version using   :func:`networkx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length`.  - Notes in the docstring that the weighted version can be obtained by using   :func:`networkx.all_pairs_dijkstra_path_length` instead.  The goal is to reduce potential confusion around whether "shortest path" refers to hop count or weighted distance, and to provide a clear demonstration in the simplest (unweighted) case, with guidance for extending to weighted graphs.  closes to #8302
