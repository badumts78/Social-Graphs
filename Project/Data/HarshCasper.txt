Fixed Code Quality Issues#TITLE_END### Description  - Use `callable()` to check if the object is calllable - Fix dangerous default argument - Remove unnecessary return statement - Add .deepsource.toml  I ran a DeepSource Analysis on my fork of this repository. You can see all the issues raised by DeepSource [here](https://deepsource.io/gh/HarshCasper/networkx/).  DeepSource helps you to automatically find and fix issues in your code during code reviews. This tool looks for anti-patterns, bug risks, performance problems, and raises issues. There are plenty of other issues in relation to Bug Discovery and Anti-Patterns which you would be interested to take a look at.  If you do not want to use DeepSource to continuously analyze this repo, I'll remove the `.deepsource.toml` from this PR and you can merge the rest of the fixes. If you want to setup DeepSource for Continuous Analysis, I can help you set that up.
