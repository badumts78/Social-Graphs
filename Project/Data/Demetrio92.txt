`ordered.Graph` reorders edges on insert#TITLE_END#While `ordered.Graph` uses python's `OrderedDict` and the nodes' order is preserved (e.g. follows the order of nodes in which they were added), edges ordering is not.   **Reproducible Example** ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.ordered.Graph() nodes = ['A','B','C'] G.add_nodes_from(nodes) G.add_edge(     u_of_edge='A',     v_of_edge='C',     attr=1 ) G.add_edge(     u_of_edge='B',     v_of_edge='C',     attr=2 ) G.add_edge(     u_of_edge='B',     v_of_edge='A',     attr=3 ) ``` ```python >>> print([id for id in G.nodes()]) ['B', 'A', 'C'] ``` ```python >>> print(G.edges(data=True)) [('B', 'C', {'attr': 2}), ('B', 'A', {'attr': 3}), ('A', 'C', {'attr': 1})] ```  ------- This is important and has far-reaching consequences, e.g. changing naming convention of the nodes, changes the results of METIS (https://github.com/networkx/networkx-metis), even with the same seed and `ordered.Graph` being used.   ------- My system: `python 3.7.5` `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS` `nx.__version__`: `2.4`
