Floyd warshall and single source shortest paths give different results#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion --> I was trying to reproduce the closeness centrality algorithm using floyd warshall but i encounter this problem using les miserables graph <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior and Expected Behavior after running floyd warshall and a loop for all node of single source shortest paths the result were different when they are supposed to be identical  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->    <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce ```python LM = nx.les_miserables_graph() nodes = LM.nodes() path_length = nx.single_source_shortest_path_length D = {} for n in nodes:     sp = path_length(LM, n)     D[n] = sp C = nx.floyd_warshall(LM) C == D  ```  Return False <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->   <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: Python 3.12.5 NetworkX version: current  ### Additional context I checked some values manually and floyd get paths of value up to 13, when single_source_shortest_path_length get the same paths to around 4  Let me know if i'm wrong thanks for the support <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
