Clarify that basis generates simple cycles only#TITLE_END#I added the **bold** part in  > A basis for cycles of a network is a minimal collection of cycles such that any **simple** cycle in the network can be written as a sum of cycles in the basis. Here summation of cycles is defined as "exclusive or" of the edges. Cycle bases are useful, e.g. when deriving equations for electric circuits using Kirchhoff's Laws.  because in the graph below, the cycle basis is `[[L1, L2, L3], [R1, R2, R3]]`, but neither of the (non-simple) cycles `[L1, L2, L3, L1, C, L1]` and `[L1, L2, L3, L1, C, R1, R2, R3, R1, C, L1]` is a sum of the basis cycles.  ![`G = nx.Graph({"C": ["L1", "R1"], "L1": ["L2", "L3"], "L2": ["L3"], "R1": ["R2", "R3"], "R2": ["R3"]})`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/13442533/ccf6f1e2-36bb-456c-aa3d-ae2b29d73198)  ---  It appears that text in docstrings is justified. I read the contributing guidelines and installed the pre-commit hooks, but those did not automatically justify the docstring, so I added whitespace manually.

Thank you!
