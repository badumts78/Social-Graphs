TypeError: unhashable type: 'list' when adding custom Python objects containing list attributes as nodes into a graph#TITLE_END#I am trying to build a graph containing custom Python objects as nodes. These Python objects contain attributes of type list.   ### Current Behavior Whenever I want to add the object as a node, e.g. `graph.add_node(obj)`, the following error is thrown: `TypeError`: unhashable type: 'list'  ### Expected Behavior I would expect the object to be added as a node like any primitive type, such as `int`.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> The following simple code snippet reproduces the error:  ```python import networkx as nx from typing import NamedTuple, List  class Book(NamedTuple):   title: str   authors: List[str]  book = Book("Foo", ["Bar", "Foo"])  graph = nx.DiGraph() graph.add_node(book) # triggers the described error ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: **3.6** NetworkX version: **2.5.1**  Is it an expected behavior or am I missing something here?
