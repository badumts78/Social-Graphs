Branchings.py - A new approach#TITLE_END#Hi everybody! I'm glad to be here!  I am working on my master degree thesis using the Edmonds algorithm and I made some changes to the original Networkx implementation. Particularly, I removed the two structures that store the graphs and branchings for every step, in favor of an unique structure able to rebuild the graphs needed for the second phase of the algorithm.  I would like that what I made could be part of networkx. I hope this is the right place to post my patch!
