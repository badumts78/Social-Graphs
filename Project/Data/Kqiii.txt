Incorret degree given by nx.degree() function#TITLE_END#Hi,   I find that in a graph where some nodes have self-loops, the nx.degree() function would give wrong results for even nodes _without_ self-loops.  Please see the below screeshots for details, where I wrote some explanations (in orange) for my codes:  This screenshot shows that degree of the 5-th node (do not have self-loops) given by nx.degree() is not correct: <img width="728" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-09 at 3 08 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38380341/101598378-082f6900-3a33-11eb-94ff-c821c87e3669.png">  This screenshot shows that this problem also occurs for some other nodes without self-loops:  <img width="482" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-09 at 3 16 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38380341/101598381-0a91c300-3a33-11eb-95c1-67e58e26a684.png">  Thank you!
