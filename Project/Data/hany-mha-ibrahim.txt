strange behavoir for contracted_nodes#TITLE_END#The code below makes a strange behavior as far as I understand the documentation and the source code of the function contracted_nodes. contracted_nodes is supposed to delete the node contracted, but for some reason, this does not happen in this case. Also, the deleted node should not appear as an incident vertex.   `import networkx as nx`  `G = nx.MultiGraph()` `G.add_node('3')` `G.add_node('4')` `G.add_node('7')`  `G.add_edge('3', '4')` `G.add_edge('3', '7')` `G.add_edge('4', '4')`  `print G.nodes() , G.edges()` `GG= nx.contracted_nodes( G , '3' , '4' );` `print GG.nodes() , GG.edges()` G is a multigraph and has a self loop on the node which is suposed to be deleted.
