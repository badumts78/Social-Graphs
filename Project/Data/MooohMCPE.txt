issue
nx.adjacency_matrix returns the incorrect adjacency matrix#TITLE_END#I believe there could be a bug with the built-in adjacency matrix function in Networkx  ![image](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/125153936/e2806e17-c317-4b01-a90e-95d0eea4da46) The first matrix in the output terminal is one that I personally inputted. It was used to derive a minimum spanning tree M through Kruskal's algorithm.  The second matrix is the minimum spanning tree's adjacency matrix derived from the built-in method.  I have also printed the list of the minimum spanning tree's edges to demonstrate that an issue might exist in the built-in function's output, as it returns edges that do not exist in the edge list.
