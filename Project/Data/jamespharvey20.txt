I think I ran into this same issue, but I'm not positive.  Using networkx 2.8.6, numpy 1.23.2, and matplotlib 3.5.3, with the following code:  ``` import networkx as nx import numpy as np import matplotlib  array = np.array([[ 0, 1, 1],    [1, 0, 1],    [1, 1, 0]    ]) graph = nx.from_numpy_matrix(array, create_using=nx.Graph) layout=nx.circular_layout(graph) nx.draw(graph, layout) labels = nx.get_edge_attributes(graph, 'weight') nx.draw_network_edge_labels(graph, pos=the_layout, edge_labels=labels) ```  I get the following exception:  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/mnt/fast/delivery.git/src/main.py", line 394, in <module>     new_main()   File "/mnt/fast/delivery.git/src/main.py", line 344, in new_main     nx.draw_network_edge_labels(graph, pos=the_layout, edge_labels=labels)   File "/mnt/fast/delivery.git/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/networkx/__init__.py", line 51, in __getattr__     raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__} has no attribute {name}") AttributeError: module networkx has no attribute draw_network_edge_labels ```  If I place a breakpoint on `__init__.py::51`, I can see that `name = {str} 'utils'`.  I seem to be running the merge from 29 days ago, since I think that's included in numpy 1.23.2.  I'm running python 3.10.5.  Notably, this runs fine through JupyterLab running on the same machine, and only fails when I try running it through my own Python program.  I have no idea what versions JupyterLab is using of everything, and why it acts differently.

> @jamespharvey20 from the posted traceback it actually seems like the cause is a simple misspelling of the function name. Try `draw_networkx_edge_labels`. >  > Apologies if I'm missing something obvious  Haha, my apologies!  Yes, you're right.  I hope you saw that quickly.  Adding the `x` makes it run fine.  PyCharm isn't able to pick up that there's a problem there.  I'm fairly new to Python, and didn't recognize that's the wording it gives if you try calling a non-existent function.
