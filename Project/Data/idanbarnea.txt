MultiGraph initialization with dict-of-dict-of-dict-of-dict doesn't work properly#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior The initialization of a multigraph with dictionaries treats the third dictionary, which its keys suppose to be the edges IDs, as the attribute of the edge. ### Expected Behavior Initializing a multigraph should not accept dictionaries, or it should use reserved keys for edges' IDs. ### Steps to Reproduce ``` g = networkx.MultiGraph({'a': {'b': {0: {'w': 200}, 1: {'w': 201}}}}) print(g.edges) h = networkx.MultiGraph() h.add_edges_from([('a', 'b', {"w": 200}), ('a', 'b', {"w": 201})]) print(h.edges)  output  [('a', 'b', 0)] [('a', 'b', 0), ('a', 'b', 1)] ``` ### Environment Python version: 3.9.5 NetworkX version: 2.5.1
