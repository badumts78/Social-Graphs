fix bug for to_scipy_sparse_matrix function#TITLE_END#The nx.to_scipy_sparse_matrix(G, nodelist=None, dtype=None, weight='weight', format='csr') function will raise a ValueError if the the input graph G contains selfloops, but the subgraph induced on the input nodelist does not contains any selfloop. For example:  >>> g = nx.Graph() >>> g.add_edges_from([[0,0],[1,2],[1,3]]) >>> nx.to_scipy_sparse_matrix(g, [1,2]) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "XXX/networkx/convert_matrix.py", line 845, in to_scipy_sparse_matrix     for u, v, d in selfloops ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)  So when we subtract the data on the diagonal to avoid selfloop entries get double counted when symmetrizing, we only judge if the subgraph induced on the input nodelist contains selfloops, otherwise, we do not have to do the subtraction.
