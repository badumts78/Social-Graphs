issue
A question about program efficiency and shortest path length#TITLE_END#1. Some key functions of NetworkX seem not to be efficient enough to support large network analysis. I have built a directed network with 5000 nodes and 35450 edges. Now I decide to look into the properties of the network so I called functions below in these codes: ``` avg_shortest_path_length = nx.average_shortest_path_length(net) density = nx.density(net) avg_connectividy = na.connectivity.average_node_connectivity(net) betweenness_centrality = na.betweenness_centrality(net) closeness_centrality = na.closeness_centrality(net) ``` I started the analysis approximately 9 hours ago, and until now the program has not returned any values. It may be relavant to my PC configuration, but similar analysis in Gephi could be carried out within 1 min. So I am rather concerned that if there is some unseen problems need to solve. Or if there is any mistake in my codes, will you please be so kind to point them out? I would be appreciated. 2. Another problem is that I do not understand why the function `average_shortest_path_length()` requires a connected or weakly connected network to perform? If the network does not meet these requirements the function will raise a error, but in Gephi same analysis could be carried out without these requirements. I think if some nodes are not connected and there is no path, we can simply ignore them and calculate the average of other paths, but current version of NetworkX seems not to support this function. And I am interested to know how to calculate average shortest path length when the network is not connected with NetworkX.
