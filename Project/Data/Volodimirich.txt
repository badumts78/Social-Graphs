grid_2d_graph topology with write_dot question#TITLE_END#Hello, I have a question about working with nx.grid_2d_graph topology. In this topology, the node has the type - tuple: (ylevel, xlevel). If this topology is saved using the write_dot(G, path) method, the vertices correspond to tuple in the dot file, which leads to further problems (in other modules where this graph is used).  Is there any way to recalculate the vertices of the graph except for recreating the graph similar to the previous one?

nx_agraph.read_dot() weight bug#TITLE_END#I met a slightly unpleasant bug. If you load the graph from the dot notation (`read_dot`) and then try to apply `all_pairs_dijkstra_path_length`, an error occurs: _Unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'._ This happens because the weights of the edges in this graph are of type str. As a personal solution, I propose to add _dijkstra_multisource to the _weighted.py_ file instead: `cost = weight(v, u, e)` do `cost = int(weight(v, u, e))` (If the ribs are integers)
