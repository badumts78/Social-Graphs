add draw_sudoku function#TITLE_END#Refer to this PR in nx-guides https://github.com/networkx/nx-guides/pull/54  Relevant comments   - https://github.com/networkx/nx-guides/pull/54#pullrequestreview-799305610 - https://github.com/networkx/nx-guides/pull/54#issuecomment-1015906468    About this PR - This PR adds a function which can create neat sudoku visualisations for n=3 and even n=4, they can mostly be of pedagogical value but I think it'll be a cool thing to have in the library for people who are fond of graph theory, it's like a nice quirk(!!!!)  - It's primarily for nx-guides so it might or might not be a good fit here, do let me know! - It isn't polished up yet so please feel free to comment/give feedback/correct etc - Some other ideas 1. maybe I should only export the separate edges or provide customisation on how users want to colour them? 2. Maybe exporting the graph in gexf or something would be nice? but i dont think any of them preserve edge color etc 3. Atleast add an option to save the matplotlib figure with some customizations
