issue
infinite loop with bellman ford negative cycle#TITLE_END#This graph causes an infinite loop with bellman ford short path. Note : I had to write it in pickle format since it seems the bug does not occurs when loading from other formats (node : the node keys are ints while with other format, they loads as str and the negative cycle is spotted).   [BUG.pickle.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/4684398/BUG.pickle.zip)  To reproduce : (python 3.8.2) :  ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.read_gpickle('BUG.pickle') nx.single_source_bellman_ford(G, -1, target=-2, weight='w')  ``` With a debugger, we can see the relaxation loop is done but there is a cycle in pred.
