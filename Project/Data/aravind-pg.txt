Ensure nx.power preserves all original nodes#TITLE_END#Since the implementation was only adding nodes as a byproduct of adding edges, it ended up dropping zero-degree nodes. This fixes things by initializing the result to contain all original nodes. Fixes #2454.
issue
nx.power does not preserve zero-degree nodes#TITLE_END#```shell >>> G = nx.Graph() >>> G.add_nodes_from([0, 1, 2]) >>> G.add_edge(0, 1) >>> G2 = nx.power(G, 2) >>> G.nodes() [0, 1, 2] >>> G2.nodes() [0, 1] ```  Here `nx.power` fails to preserve the zero-degree node 2 in `G2`. This happens for all graphs in all such scenarios.  It is easy to see the problem: [the implementation](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/operators/product.py#L415-L434) adds nodes only as a byproduct of adding edges, and never actually initializes the result to contain all original nodes. A simple fix would be to change [this line](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/operators/product.py#L415) to `H = G.copy()` or `H = nx.Graph(); H.add_nodes_from(G.nodes())`. I can make a quick PR if this fix makes sense.
