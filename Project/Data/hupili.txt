issue
Inconsistency in g.node, g.succ and g.pred#TITLE_END#I assume the keys set of g.node, g.succ and g.pred are the same at any time. The sequence to produce error is as follows.   First build the graph:  ``` g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edges_from([....]) ```  Then check consistency:  ``` set(g.succ.keys()) - set(g.node) set(g.pred.keys()) - set(g.node) ```  The two lines returned non-empty set (1 element).  This will cause error in forthcoming calls of other functions like `networkx.draw`.   Since the data set is private and I have not found a minimal case to reproduce the error yet. I open an issue first and hope someone can share some insights.
