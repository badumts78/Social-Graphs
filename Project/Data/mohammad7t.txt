Graphml: consistent I/O for key and data attributes of edges in multi-graphs#TITLE_END#Before this commit, in order to write a multigraph to qraphml file, both `key` and `data` items of  edges(`G.edges(keys=True, data=True).items()`) were stored as `<data>` children of `<edge>` elements. This caused difference in edges of multigraphs with key and data attributes, before and after consequent write and reads of graphml. `test_preserve_multi_edge_data` was added to `test_graphml.py` to show this inconsistency. This commit changes graphml reader and writer behavior to:  * read and write `key` of networkx edges only in `id` attribute of `<edge id="...">` elements of graphml. * read and write `data` of networkx edges only in `<data></data>` elements of graphml.  Only in non-multigraphs, `id` attribute of `<edge id="...">` elements will be read into `data` of networkx edges, because we have no `key` for edges.
