issue
Can't verify if minimum_st_node_cut actually works correctly or not#TITLE_END#Hi. I've been trying to determine the affect capacity has on cuts in a DiGraph playing with different graph shapes and capacity values. Maybe I'm completely off base, but I've scoured the Internet for small graph min cut samples (from university courses) with examples but have yet to successfully cut the same nodes/edges.  My work is on another system, so I'll include a hand produced example in-line. The graph is based on the following, look under "Practice": http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/323/Syllabus/NetFlow/max-flow-min-cut.html  ``` import networkx as nx # NetworkX v1.10 ... G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edge("s", "a", capacity=8) G.add_edge("s", "b", capacity=7) G.add_edge("s", "c", capacity=4)  G.add_edge("a", "b", capacity=2) G.add_edge("b", "c", capacity=5)  G.add_edge("a", "d", capacity=3) G.add_edge("b", "e", capacity=6) G.add_edge("c", "f", capacity=2)  G.add_edge("a", "e", capacity=9) G.add_edge("c", "e", capacity=7)  G.add_edge("d", "t", capacity=9) G.add_edge("e", "t", capacity=5) G.add_edge("f", "t", capacity=8)  cut_nodes = nx.algorithms.connectivity.minimum_node_cut(G, "s", "t") print "Cut nodes: " + str(cut_nodes) # Always produces cuts for d, f, e  cut_edges = nx.algorithms.connectivity.minimum_edge_cut(G, "s", "t") print "Cut edges: " + str(cut_edges) # Always produces cuts for d->t, f->t, e->t ```  The Emory course explaination indicates that a->d, e->t, c->f should be the cut edges by capacity.  I've played with simplier graphs and the capacities never seem to affect the results.
