Performance improvement for astar_path#TITLE_END#Solves issue #6722   Use `G._adj[node].items()` to iterate over node's neighbors in `astar_path()`  to reduce overhead.
issue
Inefficient implementation of astar_path#TITLE_END#I noticed that `astar_path()` doesn't give me any noticeable performance advantage over `dijkstra_path()` on my data despite traversing almost two times less nodes.  This happens because `astar_path()` uses `G[node].items()` to iterate over node's neighbors, which causes overhead during iteration: ![astar_orig_profile](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/2076950/8fd5e1ef-cdd2-4725-bb14-a02ff665fc8d)  `dijkstra_path()` uses `G._adj[node].items()`, that doesn't have such overhead. Modifying `astar_path()` to use the same method makes it almost twice faster than before: ![astar_new_profile](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/2076950/323a706e-bb4a-4a10-9d6f-e14b51aeaa93)  ### Environment  Python version: 3.9.0 NetworkX version: 3.1
