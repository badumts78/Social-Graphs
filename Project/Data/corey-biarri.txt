dfs_edges can miss edges when no source provided#TITLE_END#When running `dfs_edges` with a directed graph, it may not return all the edges.   ### Current Behavior Depending on the arbitrary node selected to start the dfs search, edges may be missed.  ``` >>> g = nx.DiGraph() >>> g.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (0, 1)]) >>> list(nx.dfs_edges(g)) [(1, 2)] ```  whereas this works as expected ``` >>> g = nx.DiGraph() >>> g.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2)]) >>> list(nx.dfs_edges(g)) [(0, 1), (1, 2)] ```  ### Expected Behavior When there is no source provided, I expected all edges to be returned. eg  ``` >>> g = nx.DiGraph() >>> g.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (0, 1)]) >>> list(nx.dfs_edges(g)) [(0, 1), (1, 2)] ```  ### Steps to Reproduce See example above.   ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.6.13 NetworkX version: 2.5.1
