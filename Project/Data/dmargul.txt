issue
find_cycle() does not find re-find a cycle if a component edge is removed and re-added#TITLE_END#I have been trying to find, remove, and then rebuild cycles in a large network. I am unable to use find_cycle() to find the same cycle twice if I have removed and re-added a cyclic edge in between attempts.  ### Current Behavior get_edge_data() confirms that all component edges of should-be cycles exist.  find_cycle() cannot find the cycle that should be closest to a source node  ### Expected Behavior I imagine I should be able to remove an edge, add it back, and be left with a graph that responds identically to a cycle finding algorithm.  ### Steps to Reproduce     import networkx as nx          # Generate large graph and  look for closest cycle to source node '1'     graph = nx.generators.random_graphs.erdos_renyi_graph(200, 0.01, seed=1, directed=True)     test = nx.find_cycle(graph, source=1)     print(test)      # Confirm the same cycle is found first on same graph with same source node     test = nx.find_cycle(graph, source=1)     print(test)      # Remove & re-add the first edge from the cycle that was found     graph.remove_edge(test[0][0], test[0][1])     graph.add_edge(test[0][0], test[0][1])      # Look for closest cycle to source node '1'     test = nx.find_cycle(graph, source=1)     print(test)      output:     [(11, 0), (0, 14), (14, 30), (30, 77), (77, 132), (132, 44), (44, 6), (6, 48), (48, 32), (32, 71), (71, 11)]     [(11, 0), (0, 14), (14, 30), (30, 77), (77, 132), (132, 44), (44, 6), (6, 48), (48, 32), (32, 71), (71, 11)]     [(39, 54), (54, 2), (2, 67), (67, 104), (104, 12), (12, 85), (85, 107), (107, 11), (11, 184), (184, 50), (50, 39)]  ### Environment Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.5.1
