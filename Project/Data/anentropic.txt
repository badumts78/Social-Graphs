use raise from for exceptions in to_networkx_graph#TITLE_END#fixes: #4002 
issue
Unhelpful generic error message in to_networkx_graph#TITLE_END#I'm trying to instantiate a `DiGraph` from a view of a `MultiDiGraph` filtered to select only one out of any parallel edges.  Right this minute I'm not sure if I constructed my graph or graph view wrong, but the point is I'm getting this error:  ``` networkx.exception.NetworkXError: Input is not a correct NetworkX graph. ```  It comes from the call to `convert.to_networkx_graph` in `DiGraph.__init__` which has this code: ```python         if hasattr(data, "adj"):             try:                 result = from_dict_of_dicts(data.adj,                                             create_using=create_using,                                             multigraph_input=data.is_multigraph())                 if hasattr(data, 'graph'):  # data.graph should be dict-like                     result.graph.update(data.graph)                 if hasattr(data, 'nodes'):  # data.nodes should be dict-like                     # result.add_node_from(data.nodes.items()) possible but                     # for custom node_attr_dict_factory which may be hashable                     # will be unexpected behavior                     for n, dd in data.nodes.items():                         result._node[n].update(dd)                 return result             except:                 raise nx.NetworkXError("Input is not a correct NetworkX graph.") ```  Fortunately my test graph is very small and hand-constructed and I will step through in a debugger and work out what's wrong.  But it'd be great if this code didn't swallow the source of the actual error.  How would you feel if I opened a Pull Request to change this to: ```python     try:         ...     except Exception as e:         raise nx.NetworkXError("Input is not a correct NetworkX graph.") from e ``` ?  Thanks for a great library!

improve docs for subgraph_view filter_edge#TITLE_END#fixes: #4003 
issue
Docs for subgraph_view filter_edges function when using a MultiGraph#TITLE_END#I found that my actual error I needed to debug in #4002 was:  ```python     def edge_ok(nbr, key): >       return self.NODE_OK(nbr) and self.EDGE_OK(node, nbr, key) E       TypeError: <lambda>() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given ``` from `networkx/classes/coreviews.py:392`  The problem seems to be that I have created the view I am instantiating the `DiGraph` with, via `nx.subgraph_view` with a filter function for edges, passing in the parent `MultiDiGraph`.  The error occurs when instantiating the new graph, suggesting the subgraph view is built lazily, which is cool.  But the docs for `subgraph_view` don't mention that my `filter_edge` function should take 3 args instead of 2 if it's a MultiGraph: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.subgraph_view.html It just says: > A function taking as input the two nodes describing an edge, which returns `True` if the edge should appear in the view.  But if it's a `MultiGraph` or `MultiDiGraph` then the filter function should take three args: the two nodes plus the edge key.  I fixed that in my code and I'm now able to successfully instantiate the `DiGraph` from the filtered view.  Does this sound right? I'm happy to send a PR to update the docs.

What is the difference between topological_sort and topological_sort_recursive?#TITLE_END#The docs don't describe any difference, except that the latter is 'recursive'.  Are they expected to return the same result?  Is it just a matter of using a different algorithm, so they may have different performance depending on your graph structure?  (this is how it looks to me from reading the source)  It would be nice to have a hint about why both methods exist.
