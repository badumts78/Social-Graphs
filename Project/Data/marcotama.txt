issue
pygraphviz should be added to networkx requirements#TITLE_END#### Subject of the issue The module `pygraphviz` is required (not having it yields an exception), and thus it should be added to requirements.txt and to `networkx` requirements.  ### Your environment * networkx version 1.11 * Python version 3.7 * Operating System MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)  ### Steps to reproduce ``` nx_graph = nx.DiGraph(directed=True) nx_graph.add_edges_from([('A', 'B'), ('C', 'B')]) graph = nx.drawing.nx_agraph.to_agraph(nx_graph) ``` raises a `ImportError`: ```   File "/path/to/my/script.py", line 1116, in generate_graph     graph = nx.drawing.nx_agraph.to_agraph(nx_graph)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_agraph.py", line 135, in to_agraph     'http://pygraphviz.github.io/') ImportError: ('requires pygraphviz ', 'http://pygraphviz.github.io/') ```
