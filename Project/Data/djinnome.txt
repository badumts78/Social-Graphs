issue
draw_network_edges allows curved edges or dashed edges, but not both.#TITLE_END#Hi folks,  I would very much like to create curved, dashed  edges for either directed or undirected graphs.  However, it seems I can only have curved, **but not dashed** edges for directed graphs, even though I specify `style="dashed"` ```python G = nx.DiGraph([('X','Y')]) pos = nx.spring_layout( G ) nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos,                        nodelist=list(G.nodes)) nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos,                        edgelist=list(G.edges),                        style='dashed',                        connectionstyle="arc3,rad=0.3",                       ) plt.savefig('solid-curved-directed-edge.png') ```  ![solid-curved-directed-edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/144210/56476144-5354cc80-6448-11e9-94ef-28c311ad9dac.png)   Furthermore, it seems I can only get dashed, **but not curved**, edges for undirected graphs.  even though I specify `connectionstyle="arc3,rad=0.3"`  ```python G = nx.Graph([('X','Y')]) pos = nx.spring_layout( G ) nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos,                        nodelist=list(G.nodes)) nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos,                        edgelist=list(G.edges),                        style='dashed',                        connectionstyle="arc3,rad=0.3",                       ) plt.savefig('dashed-straight-undirected-edge.png') ```  ![dashed-straight-undirected-edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/144210/56476149-610a5200-6448-11e9-9dfd-061270f0c235.png)  Please advise.  Thanks so much,  Jeremy
