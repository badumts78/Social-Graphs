Possible bug in nx.graph.degree() returning incorrect degree#TITLE_END#![screenshot from 2017-09-19 11-17-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10602903/30577507-51cd0f6a-9d2c-11e7-8a24-a444b0a708a9.png) Code to reproduce: ``` import networkx as nx import numpy as np A = np.random.random((3,3)) G = nx.from_numpy_matrix(A) G.edges(data=True) G.degree() ``` `G.degree()` should have returned 2 but instead it is returning 4.  If instead `G.degree(weight='weight')` is used it also doesn't return the expected sum of the weights.  If A is created as a 5x5 matrix, `G.degree()` returns degree of 6 for each of the nodes. I am not completely sure but [degree documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.DiGraph.degree.html) says it is for Digraph degree. Is that the reason for the issue?

How to cite this work?#TITLE_END#I am sorry that this is not exactly a bug, but I would like to know how to cite this repository if I am using it in my work. I couldn't find a bibtex entry on the website.

contracted_nodes with weights giving different answers according to order of inputs#TITLE_END#I am trying to use contracted nodes for a graph with weights. Here is the code :  ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge(1,3,weight=0.5) G.add_edge(1,5,weight=0.5) G.add_edge(1,7,weight=0.5) G.add_edge(0,2,weight=0.7) G.add_edge(0,4,weight=0.7) G.add_edge(0,6,weight=0.7) G.add_edge(1,6,weight=0.6) M = nx.contracted_nodes(G,1,0) N = nx.contracted_nodes(G,0,1) G.edges(data=True) M.edges(data=True) N.edges(data=True) ``` Here is the output: ![screenshot from 2017-06-13 10-36-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10602903/27095888-21715c0e-5024-11e7-85e0-b66c7ddc8fc7.png) The thing is after the contraction the new weight depends upon the order of contraction, and I feel that shouldn't be the case. It should be either the maximum or minimum of the two or perhaps an average.
