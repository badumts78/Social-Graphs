I ran into this problem as well. I am not sure, but I think I agree with @dschult on what I imagined the minimum branching would be. Maybe this logic could be used in `Edmonds` to arrive to it: 1. Set the weight of all branches to `max_edge_weight - weight + min_edge_weight`(the last part so that the edges with the maximum weight are not left out) 2. do `find_optimum` with `max` 3. Re-set the weights  For my use-case (the minimum-weight directed spanning forest) it works and I think this is the logical counterpart to maximum branching (maximum-weight directed spanning forest). (As opposed to the current behavior, which is basically "delete all edges from graph".)
