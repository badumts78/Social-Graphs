issue
Visualization with SVG, without using graphviz#TITLE_END#Is a direct SVG renderer (not via graphviz) of any interest to the upstream development?  I was to visualize some data flow charts represented with networkx in a IPython notebook. Data flow chart nodes can have very fat text labels. This scenario exposes a few drawbacks with the matplotlib rendering (networkx.draw_xxxx ) functions ( https://github.com/rainwoodman/nxsvg/blob/master/src/mpla.svg ): - no proper arrows on edges - marker representation of nodes are too small - large text labels covers tails and heads of edges - no multiline support for labels - parallel edges are overlapping  I tried to fix the matplotlib renderer, but failed. pygraphviz is a solution that I haven't explored since it requires graphviz which cannot be installed via `pip/easy_install` (I imagine that's part of why we have a builtin visualization in networkx)  In the end I wrote a simple direct SVG renderer skipping the matplotlib layer completely. It depends on 'svgwrite', which can be `pip`ed. The new renderer has specifically fixed all of these issues I listed above.  This also opens the possibility of embedding some nice javascripts that allowing the user to pan/zoom or move the nodes around. Unfortunately I don't know how to make this happen.  The SVG renderer is at  https://github.com/rainwoodman/nxsvg/blob/master/src/nxsvg.py  Currently it has support for directed edges, parallel edges and self-looping edges. I am planning to add support for colors, sub/sup-scripts,  and font-sizes in labels, with a mini-language similar to Pango markups.  Here is the same example rendered with the SVG renderer:  https://github.com/rainwoodman/nxsvg/blob/master/src/a.svg 
issue
allow bbox parameter in draw_networkx_labels#TITLE_END#This is an initial support for large verbose node labels.
