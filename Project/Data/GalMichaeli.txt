Add Functions for Finding Connected Dominating Sets#TITLE_END### Added Functionality This PR extends the functionality of `networkx/networx/algorithms/dominating.py` by adding two functions:  1. `connected_dominating_set` - takes an undirected connected graph `G`     and returns a connected dominating set (CDS) of G 2. `is_connected_dominating_set` - takes an undirected graph `G`      and an iterable `nbunch` and returns true if and only if `nbunch`     is a CDS of `G`  ## Motivation NetworkX is used extensively in the Networked Software Systems Lab at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology during reseach of various networking topics. Finding a connected dominating set (CDS) in the context of networks, especially in wireless or ad hoc networks, is crucial for optimizing communication and resource usage. A CDS serves as a virtual backbone for the network, meaning efficient routing, power conservation and network coverage.  ## Implementation Details The function `connected_dominating_set` is an implementation of Algorithm I as described in [this paper](https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers?referenceid=1979515). Quoting from the paper, "The idea behind the algorithm is the following: grow a tree T, starting from the vertex of maximum degree. At each step we pick a vertex v in T and 'scan it.' Scanning a vertex adds edges to T from v to all its neighbors not in T. In the end we find a spanning tree T, and pick the nonleaf nodes as the connected dominating set."  ## Testing Details In order to test `is_connected_dominating_set` we create a path graph G with four nodes: 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3. We then assert that {1, 2} is a CDS, {1, 3} is NOT a CDS and that {2, 3} indeed induces a connected subgraph of G but is not a dominating set. As for `connected_dominating_set`, we first test for the expected behavior in edge cases, i.e., when G is the null graph, G has only one node and G is disconnected. Next we test that for complete graphs the function returns a CDS of size 1. Finally, we define a parametrized test, in which we test connected Watts-Strogatz graphs with varying parameters and parametrized seed for reproducibility.
