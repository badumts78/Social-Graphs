issue
An encoding error dealing with '\0'#TITLE_END#Here is the story: First I have an dot file which contains a node with label "\000" Then I changed the file's format from dot to gexf.  the "\0" becomes "NUL" and the "00" after it despaired. At last I wanted to read the gexf file using ``` nx.read_gexf(g) ``` and I got an error ```  "cElementTree.ParseError: not well-formed (invalid token)" ```  which indicates that the gexf(xml) format is somehow wrong. After checking I found this error is caused by "\0" in the initial dot file, which is "NUL" in the gexf file. So I think this might be a bug.
