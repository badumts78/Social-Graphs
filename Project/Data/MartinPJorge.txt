issue
Wrong output in _all_simple_paths_multigraph()#TITLE_END#Currently `_all_simple_paths_multigraph()` returns a list of nodes rather that a set of edges with their respective keys. Thus, in case there are two edges betweeen two nodes, it is unfeasible to differentiate which edge is selected for the returned simple path.  I've created a pull request https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3358 with a modified version of `_all_simple_paths_multigraph()`, that returns the list of traversed edges with their associated key.  Please consider including it for future releases.

Index edges for multi graph simple paths#TITLE_END#Modifies `_all_simple_paths_multigraph()` to return the traversed edges rather than the nodes. The returned edges contain their associated keys, so user can distinguish across edges connecting same pair of nodes.  If we have following `MultiGraph` with these nodes and edges (with their keys): ```txt    (1,2,'k0')     ________   /          \                      1 ___________ 2  ___________ 3    (1,2,'k1')    (2,3,'k0') ```  The modified `_all_simple_paths_multigraph()` now returns: ```python import networkx as nx  mg = nx.MultiGraph() mg.add_edge(1,2,key='k0') mg.add_edge(1,2,key='k1') mg.add_edge(2,3,key='k0') paths = nx.all_simple_paths(mg, source=1, target=3) print(list(paths))  >>> [[(1,2,'k0'),(2,3,'k0')], [(1,2,'k1'),(2,3,'k0')]] ``` rather than ```python >>> [[1,2,3],[1,2,3]] ```
issue
read_gml does not retrieve a list#TITLE_END#Hi,  `read_gml` fails when reading a node property that is a single element list. Instead of reading a list of a single element, it considers that property as a single element. See the example below:  ```python import networkx as nx g = nx.Graph() g.add_node('n1', properties=['a']) nx.write_gml(g, '/tmp/test.gml') read_g = nx.read_gml('/tmp/test.gml') type(read_g.nodes['n1']['properties']) >>> <class 'str'> ``` Property's type should have been `list`, not type `str`.
comment
I am ok with the node singleton result for `nx.all_simple_paths`. In the sense that there exists a way to arrive from 0 to 0, i.e. `[0]`.  However, the graph ```python3 G = nx.Graph() G.add_node(0) ``` has no edge, and `nx.all_simple_edge_paths` should return `[]` for there is not any edge path.  If we return `[[]]`,  `len(nx.all_simple_edge_paths(G))` will yield `1` although there is no edge path.  --------- P.D.: sorry for the late reply @dschult and @plammens. And thanks a lot for the great effort! :D

I completely agree with your statement @plammens; you're right! The empty set (empty edge list) has cardinality 1.  Then, what about adding a note in the `nx.all_simple_edge_paths` docs? Many people may pitfall into thinking that ```python3 G = nx.Graph() G.add_node(0) len(list(nx.all_simple_edge_paths(G, 0, 0))) ``` yields `0` rather than `1`.

> Definitely! I forgot about updating the documentation, thanks for pointing that out. I added a note in [90dd5f9](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/90dd5f97eb225430edfc59d4fb4286d0b1d5fa2c), let me know what you think.  Looks perfect to me! Thank you. :)
