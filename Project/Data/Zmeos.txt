Fix disconnected graph bug in link prediction CCPA and add tests#TITLE_END#(Note: the question at the bottom should be discussed and addressed before merging)  Fixes a bug where CCPA throws a KeyError due to there being no path between nodes. I assume that the method should return a score of 0 if there is no path between two nodes. I make this assumption based on this being a local neighbourhood similarity score based on common neighbours and shortest path. CCPA gives a higher score for nodes that have a small shortest path and a lower score for a longer shortest path. No shortest path means the nodes have no structural connection and also no common neighbours, thus a score of 0 is sensible. This is in line with other link prediction methods (based on common neighbours) which simply returns a score of 0 inherently, due to there being no common neighbours.  I suspect that this would normally have been caught if the method had tests. So I added tests. The bug fixed is covered by the "test_no_common_neighbor" test.  The behaviour can be replicated with the following code. ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from([0, 1]) list(nx.common_neighbor_centrality(G)) ``` Expected behaviour, returns: `[(0, 1, 0)]`  Observed behaviour, throws KeyError.  Before this is merged, I have a question. Other link prediction methods were tested on links between equal nodes (the `test_equal_nodes` test). CCPA in its current state throws a ZeroDivisionError on this test, since the shortest path is zero. I've added the test but commented it out. I'll adapt the test based on what we decide.  It is less clear to me what a sensible score for equal nodes should be as I'm not familiar with any use case for such a prediction. I see at least two options: 1. Leave the functionality as is and modify the test to expect an exception. In this case, should the method call fail with an informative error and error message, which one? 2. Assume a score for this case. In this case, what would a sensible score be?
