issue
Planarity section has a typo `iff` (should be `if`) twice#TITLE_END#Planarity section, when defines what a planar graph is (e.g. [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.planarity.is_planar.html#networkx.algorithms.planarity.is_planar)), says:  > A graph is planar **iff** it can be drawn in a plane without any edge intersections.  Which is a typo and it happens in two places across the docs.

Remove redundant graph copy in `algorithms.bridges.bridges()`#TITLE_END#Closes #7469  
issue
`algorithms.bridges.bridges()` does a redundant copy of graph#TITLE_END#This is the code of the `bridges` function:  ```python def bridges(G, root=None):     multigraph = G.is_multigraph()     H = nx.Graph(G) if multigraph else G     chains = nx.chain_decomposition(H, root=root)     chain_edges = set(chain.from_iterable(chains))     H_copy = H.copy()     if root is not None:         H = H.subgraph(nx.node_connected_component(H, root)).copy()     for u, v in H.edges():         if (u, v) not in chain_edges and (v, u) not in chain_edges:             if multigraph and len(G[u][v]) > 1:                 continue             yield u, v ```  The statement in the middle:  ```python     H_copy = H.copy() ```  Seem to have no effect, because `H_copy` is not used anywhere else in this module, and therefore **can be removed**.  ### Current Behavior  Actually in addition to being redundant due to `H_copy` not used anywhere, presence of this statement makes extending the `networkx.Graph` class harder.  If you inherit from `networkx.Graph` and your class would have a constructor that requires some parameters to be provided, you wouldn't be able to use the `bridges()` function at all. Because this `.copy()` method has the following line:  ```python # Body of .copy() method G = self.__class__() ```  And for inheritors of `networkx.Graph` that have custom constructors `self.__class__()` raises `TypeError` on missing arguments.  ### Expected Behavior  There should be no redundant lines, and `bridges()` should work for inheritors as long as they don't override some dependent methods.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Set up for example this:  ```python class Map(nx.Graph):      def __init__(self: tp.Self, routes: tp.Iterable[str]) -> None:         super().__init__() ```  Initialize this object like `Map(routes=("a", "b"))` and try using `bridges()` with it.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version: 3.3
