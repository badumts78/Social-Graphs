issue
Function add_nodes_from does not use adjlist_dict_factory properly#TITLE_END#While I was reading through the code of the Graph class, I have found what I think must be a bug in the implementation. Look at the code below:  ``` python for n in nodes:   # keep all this inside try/except because   # CPython throws TypeError on n not in self.succ,   # while pre-2.7.5 ironpython throws on self.succ[n]    try:     if n not in self.node:       self.adj[n] = self.adjlist_dict_factory()       self.node[n] = attr.copy()     else:       self.node[n].update(attr)   except TypeError:     nn,ndict = n     if nn not in self.node:       self.adj[nn] = {}       newdict = attr.copy()       newdict.update(ndict)       self.node[nn] = newdict     else:       olddict = self.node[nn]       olddict.update(attr)       olddict.update(ndict) ```  So, the problem is with these two lines: **self.adj[n] = self.adjlist_dict_factory()** in the try part of the code and **self.adj[nn] = {}** after the except TypeError if the node is not present in the graph  Both assignments initialize in different ways the adjacency list for a node. I think this could lead to weird behavior when calling this function.
