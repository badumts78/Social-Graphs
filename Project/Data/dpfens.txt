issue
adds implementation of SNAP summarization algorithm#TITLE_END#An implementation of the SNAP graph summarization algorithm from [Efficient Aggregation for Graph Summarization](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/publ/summarization.pdf).  This algorithm creates a summary graph of supernodes, where supernodes represent sets of nodes that have the same attributes and edges with nodes in the same supernodes in the summary graph.
issue
fixes Github Actions failures#TITLE_END#Github Actions failing due to new release of [pyyaml==5.4](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/#history) this change will ensure that version 5.3 is used.  There may be a better/simpler way to account for this issue, just let me know.

issue
adds dedensification function#TITLE_END#**NOTE**:  This change was originally found in pull request #3856, but Github Actions wouldn't work anymore due to changes to the `.github/workflow` files since my initial fork, so I re-forked and re-implemented the changes.  Original content:  Adds dedensification (`networkx.algorithms.dedensification.dedensify`) and densification (`networkx.algorithms.dedensification.densify`) functions as defined in [Scalable Pattern Matching over Compressed Graphs via Dedensification](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/papers/graph-dedense.pdf) with option for `expansive` or `nonexpansive` results, and option for `inplace` dedensification or densification.  Examples of how functions can be called: ```python import networkx as nx  graph = nx.DiGraph() # build structure of graph by adding nodes and edges  dedensified_graph, compression_nodes = nx.algorithms.dedensification.dedensify(graph, threshold=10, prefix='compression-')  # perform business operations on dedensified graph  # convert dedensified graph back into original graph densified_graph = nx.algorithms.dedensification.densify(dedensified_graph, compression_nodes) ```
