Add Functionality to Display DiGraph in ASCII Format#TITLE_END#### Proposal: Currently, NetworkX does not provide a built-in function to display graphs in ASCII art format. This proposal suggests adding a new functionality to NetworkX that allows users to visualize graphs as ASCII art, providing a textual representation of the graph's structure.  ### Proposed Solution: - Create a new function, e.g., display_ascii, that takes a graph as input and generates an ASCII art representation of the graph's nodes and edges. - Ensure that the function can handle both directed and undirected graphs. - Include relevant documentation updates, including the docstring, to explain how to use the new functionality.  ``` └── A     ├── B     │   └── D     └── C         ├── E         ├── F         └── G ```  ### Additional Information: This feature would enhance NetworkX's usability and make it more accessible for users who prefer textual representations of graphs for various purposes, including teaching, debugging, and documentation.
