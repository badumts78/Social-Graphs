How to represent Input & Output node slots#TITLE_END#I was interested on using networkx on one pyqt widget similar to blender's node graph editor. What's the proper way to have input & output slots on my graphs/subgraphs?  I know having a DiGraph i'd have access to in_edges and out_edges but not sure if that's what i'm looking for, any advice?  Also, any well-known pyqt software using networkx behind the curtains?
