Issue #6344 numpy error#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> Dear networkx team. We have created a pull request (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6344) but we are having trouble with the tests that we added. The automatic check writes that no module named 'numpy' when it's checking our tests. In this pull request, we uploaded a file that shows where the problem happens.   This file is located here: (https://github.com/danigil/networkx/blob/issue-%236344-numpy-error/networkx/algorithms/bipartite/EFM_algorithms.py).
