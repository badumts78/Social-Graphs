issue
Document id is reserved attribute name if serialisation is used#TITLE_END#I tried to create graph nodes with `id` attribute:  ``` graph = networkx.Graph() for (i, name) in enumerate(items):         graph.add_node(name, id=i+2000, type="object") ```  then on attempt to serialise with `json_graph.dump`, I received the following error:  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\dev\scripts\create_graph.py", line 46, in <module>     run()   File "C:\dev\scripts\create_graph.py", line 43, in run     save(g, "scripts/g.json")   File "C:\dev\scripts\create_graph.py", line 34, in save     json_graph.dump(graph, open(filename, "w"),indent=2, separators=(',', ': '))   File "C:\Python32\lib\json\__init__.py", line 183, in dump     for chunk in iterable:   File "C:\Python32\lib\json\encoder.py", line 422, in _iterencode     o = _default(o)   File "C:\Python32\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\json_graph\serialize.py", line 15, in default     return node_link_data(o)   File "C:\Python32\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\json_graph\node_link.py", line 52, in node_link_data     data['nodes'] = [ dict(id=n, **G.node[n]) for n in G ]   File "C:\Python32\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\json_graph\node_link.py", line 52, in <listcomp>     data['nodes'] = [ dict(id=n, **G.node[n]) for n in G ] TypeError: type object got multiple values for keyword argument 'id' ```  I figured out the offending line was   ```         graph.add_node(name, id=i+2000, type="object") ```  and after replacing `id` attribute with different one, i.e. `node_id`, serialisation succeeded with the following output:  ``` ...     {       "node_id": 2010,       "type": "object",       "id": "group"     }, ... ```  Apparently, the `id` is a reserved keyword by serialisation (perhaps not only JSON), somewhat implicitly. It would be nice to have such limitation documented.  Kudos for the fantastic networkx library!
