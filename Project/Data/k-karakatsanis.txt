Functions to test if a graph is weighted (or negatively weighted)#TITLE_END#This pull request adds two functions which are related with the weights of a graph.  The **weighted_edges** function checks if all graph's edges or a specific edge is weighted. The **negative_weights** function  checks if the graph has a negatively weighted edge or if a specific edge of the graph has negative weight.  Also, test functions are added, with 100% code coverage.
