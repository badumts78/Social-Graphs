Reference for inverse_line_graph#TITLE_END#There is a spelling mistake in the reference for the documentation of inverse_line_graph (latest version).   https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.line.inverse_line_graph.html  The author is "N. D. Roussopoulos" instead of N. Roussopolous (note the location of "ou"). Also, it would be nice to add a link or DOI to the article.
