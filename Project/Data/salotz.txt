issue
Premature deprecation#TITLE_END#I noticed that in 2.4 release a number of methods on the core graph classes were deprecated. See: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/6b1ce03f485076d39994e8d624bbf6ca82466eb9#r35619092  In the comments it says these will be deprecated in 3.0. Perhaps this was an accident to remove them for 2.4?  I would request that unless there is a really good reason, to put these methods back along with any other deprecations. It really is not fun to have the rug pulled out from under you and there probably is no reason other than cleaner code to get rid of them. If NetworkX is following semantic versioning then this would go against the rules there as well.  At the least deprecation warnings should be put in place a couple releases in advance.

added documentation for write_gexf viz attrs#TITLE_END#I added a sentence describing that networkx does indeed write attributes like visualization parameters, "viz", correctly according to the GEXF schema.  I added an example setting the size color and layout positions of a node which was tested to work in Gephi 8.0.2.  There was a few questions on stackoverflow and some promoting work-around behavior because it was not evident in the documentation.  I will note that beyond viz there are other behaviors that are not documented and the user would not know they are available without actually reading through the code.
