Add Real-Time Adaptive A* (RTAA*) algorithm for shortest paths#TITLE_END#### Summary  This PR introduces the Real-Time Adaptive A* (RTAA*) algorithm into the NetworkX library, offering an efficient, real-time pathfinding method.  ### Features  - New functions:   - `rtaa_star_path(G, source, target, ...)`   - `rtaa_star_path_length(...)` - Supports:   - Lookahead and move limit   - Custom heuristic functions   - ALT heuristic with landmarks   - Arbitrary edge weights (attributes or callable) - Compatible with directed and undirected graphs  ### Tests  - Includes full test suite under `shortest_paths/tests/` - Covers:   - Correctness   - Exceptions (e.g., NodeNotFound, NetworkXNoPath)   - Comparisons with A* and Dijkstra   - Custom heuristics and landmarks   - Edge cases (non-orderable nodes, null heuristics)  ### References  - Koenig, S. & Likhachev, M. (2006). Real-Time Adaptive A*. AAMAS 2006.  ---  Looking forward to feedback!
