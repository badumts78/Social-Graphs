Reading GEXF1.3-Files#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  Currently it is not possible to read GEXF-Files with the version 1.3. As it is the code throws an NetworkXError that "No <graph> element in GEXF file". (gexf.py:707).   ### Expected Behavior  The graph should be read.   ###Analysis  As far I could see it is "just" a matter of add a new version string to the  class GEXF as there (at least in the non-dynamic version) are no really structural changes in the format specification.   ### Environment  Python version: 3.11.9 NetworkX version: 3.4.2
