Weights of betweenness centrality fail for MultiDiGraph#TITLE_END#Following up my original question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56028683/how-to-add-edge-length-as-a-weight-in-betweeness-centrality-using-osmnx-networkx) I noticed that the weight function of betweenness centrality fails for `MultiDiGraph`.   Although I found it using OSMnx package, this example illustrates the issue: ``` import networkx as nx  graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_weighted_edges_from([(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,3,1)]) print(nx.betweenness_centrality(graph)) # {1: 0.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0} print(nx.betweenness_centrality(graph, weight="weight")) # {1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0}  multi_di_graph = nx.MultiDiGraph() multi_di_graph.add_weighted_edges_from([(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,3,1)]) print(nx.betweenness_centrality(multi_di_graph)) # {1: 0.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0} print(nx.betweenness_centrality(multi_di_graph, weight="weight")) # {1: 0.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0} ``` What I did to solve the issue I converted a `MultiDiGraph` `G` into a undirected simple `Graph`   `G1` by using `G1 = nx.Graph(G)`. After that the weight function of betweenness centrality works.
