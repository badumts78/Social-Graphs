issue
Question: the created graph have been added an origin(0,0,0) by accident? #TITLE_END#I just used the nx to build a graph and display it in paraview like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25780361/68448210-fc260780-019f-11ea-9804-eda7cee9333e.png)  This looks good and shows my nodes as expected. While when show the edges, it looks like below: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25780361/68448260-24156b00-01a0-11ea-8b87-33cb79a9c712.png)  The problem is: it seems nx added an extra edge( from (0,0,0) to one of my node) the down left corner in the picture. This case is neglectable.  While I have another model which is like below: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25780361/68448345-722a6e80-01a0-11ea-8b23-c1d93da9bf87.png)  In this model, when I show the connectivity/edges, it will look like below: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25780361/68448378-8ec6a680-01a0-11ea-92f3-f78796cf675b.png)  In this case, the exta edges are crazy, so many that we can not neglect them.  My question, what mistake I may have made. We do not have the node at point (0,0,0). How to get ride of this "virtual" node, so get ride of the fake connectivity?
