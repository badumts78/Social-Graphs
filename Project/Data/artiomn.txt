Breadth traversal fix#TITLE_END## Possible bug in the graph traversal  Used graph class - `OrderedDiGraph`.  Result of the `list(networkx.edges(graph))`:  ``` [('hdf_reader', 'buffer1'), ('buffer1', 'filter1'), ('buffer1', 'filter2'), ('filter1', 'extractor_dest'), ('filter2', 'extractor_dest')] ```  Incorrect result of the `list(bfs_successors(graph, 'buffer1'))`:  ``` [('buffer1', ['filter1', 'filter2']), ('filter1', ['extractor_dest'])] ```  Correct result of the `list(bfs_successors(graph, 'buffer1'))`:  ``` [('buffer1', ['filter1', 'filter2']), ('filter1', ['extractor_dest']), ('filter2', ['extractor_dest'])] ```
