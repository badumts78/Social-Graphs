issue
graph edit distance doesn't work for non-large special, but not circular example#TITLE_END#I stumbled about it, the programe doesn't come to end. That's some minimal example:  >  > #!/usr/bin/env python > import networkx as nx > import time >  > g1 = nx.Graph() > g1.add_edges_from([(5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (21, 8), (2, 1), (2, 0), (5, 3)]) > g2 = nx.Graph() > g2.add_edges_from([(15, 13), (23, 16), (23, 24), (100, 7), (18, 19), (100, 23), (19, 20), (22, 21)]) >  > start_time = time.time() > print "starting" > dst = nx.graph_edit_distance(g1, g2) > print('  GED={0} took {1:.2f} seconds'.format(dst, time.time() - start_time))
