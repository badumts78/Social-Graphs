issue
current_flow_betweenness_centrality self loops#TITLE_END#The result for current_flow_betweenness_centrality is quite different depending on whether or not you have self loops, but the documentation doesn't indicate which way is correct.  The networks I work with typically come from correlation matrices, so I by default have self loops.  But I assume in this case I need to remove them first?  Ideally self loops would just be ignored automatically.  Compared to the documentation for clustering, which clearly states "Self loops are ignored".   
issue
unexpected modification of inputs#TITLE_END#I was surprised to find that disjoint_union_all was popping the first graph off my list of graphs.  I had further uses for that list of graphs, so it caused a number of problems when the first graph is secretly removed!  Other functions might do the same thing, I haven't checked.
