[Feature request] Signed and Weighted Clustering Coefficient#TITLE_END#[This paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088669) proposes a new a method for computing the clustering coefficient and average clustering coefficient for weighted and signed graphs. The current implementation (I believe) is only for binary graphs.  Would `networkx` be interested in the algorithm? If so, I am more than happy to work on this.

[FEA Proposal] Graph generators and embedding methods#TITLE_END#@bdpedigo and I are developers of [GraSPy](https://github.com/neurodata/graspy), which is a package for studying random graphs, and want to know if networkx is interested in these features that already exist in GraSPy:  1. [Random dot product graphs](https://graspy.neurodata.io/reference/simulations.html#graspy.simulations.rdpg) - a generative model for random graphs that is more flexible then the stochastic block model. 2. Degree-corrected stochastic block models - an extension of SBMs where nodes have degree heterogeneity. 3. [Adjacency spectral embedding](https://graspy.neurodata.io/reference/embed.html#graspy.embed.AdjacencySpectralEmbed) - embedding method for estimating parameters under RDPG model 4. [Laplacian spectral embedding](https://graspy.neurodata.io/reference/embed.html#graspy.embed.LaplacianSpectralEmbed) - a version of this exists in networkx but it is only used for [plotting](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/auto_examples/drawing/plot_spectral_grid.html?highlight=spectral)  You can think of 2 and 3 are methods for generating features given a single graph.
