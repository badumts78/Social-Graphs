spring_layout does not work for multiple-component-graphs / disjoint subgraphs - they fly away into infinity#TITLE_END#EDIT: this is probably an error where `spring_layout` fails for graphs that are actually multiple disjoint subgraphs (aka components)  ORIGINAL:  With more and more iterations, `spring_layout` approaches a layout where all connected nodes stack on top of each-other, at least in this example.  Here is my reproducible example. Nevermind where the data came from:  ```python import networkx as nx import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  edges = ((16103, 4423, {'sel_frac': 0.10104208846993425}), (58975, 4423, {'sel_frac': 0.11392450913277707}), (43510, 41220, {'sel_frac': 0.10052701693748936}), (45700, 41220, {'sel_frac': 0.11816510197282526}), (79350, 44800, {'sel_frac': 0.09355756316139689}), (15345, 50090, {'sel_frac': 0.10798202394419384}), (25610, 50090, {'sel_frac': 0.13080150443192698}), (21700, 51630, {'sel_frac': 0.13016626070338505}), (74510, 51630, {'sel_frac': 0.14163814697449248}), (75660, 86300, {'sel_frac': 0.10210561210316822}))  G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from(edges)  # Plotting pos = nx.spring_layout(G,iterations=5000)  def edge_attr(key):     return np.array(tuple(e[2][key] for e in G.edges(data=True)))  edge_widths = edge_attr('sel_frac') edge_widths = edge_widths / max(edge_widths)  edge_labels = dict([((u,v,),('%0.2f'%d['sel_frac']))                  for u,v,d in G.edges(data=True)])  pos2 = {key: value + np.array([0,0.06]) for key, value in pos.items()}  nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos) nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos2) nx.draw_networkx_edges(G,pos,width=edge_widths,labels=edge_labels) nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G,pos,edge_labels=edge_labels) plt.show() ```  ![figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18585219/53324070-1d0e2d00-389d-11e9-9b5f-bf9195c789e5.png)  As you can see, this directed network's layout converges undesirably, because all the connected nodes stack on top of each-other. This must mean the "physical forces" specified in the implementation aren't doing their job. I've played around with the parameters of `spring_layout` and nothing is satisfactory.

spring_layout (aka fruchterman_reingold) documentation needs improvement#TITLE_END#Background: In the spring_layout function, an attractive "spring force" proportional to the adjacency matrix (and proportional to the distance between nodes) exists between each pair of nodes. This is counteracted by a repulsive "anti-gravity" force inversely proportional to the distance-squared between nodes.   [code](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/d27930ce099d6f0edca8d5d91d5f3a8d9dc90c9d/networkx/drawing/layout.py#L528) ```python displacement = np.einsum('ijk,ij->ik',                                  delta,                                  (k * k / distance**2 - A * distance / k)) ```  Doing a simple estimation, this means the equilibrium distance ("Optimal distance") where these attractive and repulsive forces cancel-out currently is inversely proportional to the cube-root of the values of the adjacency matrix, which could be anything from zero to infinity. In simpler terms, multiplying the adjacency matrix by 8 results in half the equilibrium distance.  In contrast, the documentation suggests the distance is completely controlled by the parameter `k`, the inverse-spring-constant.  > k : float (default=None) >         Optimal distance between nodes.  If None the distance is set to >         1/sqrt(n) where n is the number of nodes.  Increase this value >         to move nodes farther apart.  Thus I propose to normalize the adjacency matrix values for the purpose of this layout algorithm, so that k really is the equilibrium distance: this means simply adding something like  `A = A / np.mean(A[A!=0])` before calculations. (np.median doesn't work as nicely as np.mean for some reason, other schemes possible)  Thoughts?

Added optional center_spring feature to spring_layout for unconnected graphs#TITLE_END#This addresses https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3325  Previously, spring_layout would not converge for unconnected graphs since each connected piece (component) would fly away to infinity. This optional feature (default = False, i.e. not used) fixes this.  With center_spring=True: ![Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18585219/59970561-2ee7a000-951e-11e9-9463-cece244e3daa.png)  With center_spring=False (current behavior): ![Figure_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18585219/59970566-46268d80-951e-11e9-8361-4d79ba4b6a82.png)  This also enables "petri dish" plots (a name I just invented..?) like the following: ![montecarlo_orange_vs_historical_corr_blue_with_SIC_labels_and_colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18585219/60050784-522d5f00-9686-11e9-9b99-836f4f64e399.png)
