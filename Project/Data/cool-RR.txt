Fix exception causes all over the codebase#TITLE_END#@dschult This is the last part of #4000  Besides fixing the exception causes, there were also a few malformed messages, and wrong URLs that I fixed along the way.

Fix exception causes in dag.py#TITLE_END#I recently went over [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16706), [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/32322) and [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15731), fixing a small mistake in the way that Python 3's exception chaining is used. If you're interested, I can do it here too. I've done it on just one file right now.   The mistake is this: In some parts of the code, an exception is being caught and replaced with a more user-friendly error. In these cases the syntax `raise new_error from old_error` needs to be used.  Python 3's exception chaining means it shows not only the traceback of the current exception, but that of the original exception (and possibly more.) This is regardless of `raise from`. The usage of `raise from` tells Python to put a more accurate message between the tracebacks. Instead of this:       During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:  You'll get this:       The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:  The first is inaccurate, because it signifies a bug in the exception-handling code itself, which is a separate situation than wrapping an exception.  Let me know what you think! 
issue
Fix exception causes and messages in 12 modules#TITLE_END#@dschult This is the continuation of #4000  I also noticed a few mistakes in error messages along the way, I corrected these too.
issue
Add useful `__repr__` methods#TITLE_END#For example, instead of `<networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraph object at 0x0000000003D6DE80>` we could have `<networkx.DiGraph: 7 nodes, 5 edges>`
