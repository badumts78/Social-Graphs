issue
has_edge broken for MultiDiGraph edge_subgraph#TITLE_END#   ### Current Behavior  I have come across what appears to be a bug with `has_edge` falsely reporting true on a `MultiDiGraph` `edge_subgraph`. Although, this could be me having some misunderstanding of how to use the library.  In my case, I am seeing a node "self-edge" falsely reported as present, "regular" edges do not falsely report.  ### Expected Behavior  Any graph type should properly report `has_edge` correctly.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` import networkx as nx  # Create a path graph with edges (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) simple_g: nx.Graph = nx.path_graph(5)  simple_g.add_edge(1, 1)  multi_g: nx.Graph = nx.MultiDiGraph(simple_g)  # Create an edge subgraph for each with only edges (0,1) and (3,4) simpl_g_subgraph = simple_g.edge_subgraph([(0, 1), (3, 4)]) multi_g_subgraph = multi_g.edge_subgraph([(0, 1, 0), (3, 4, 0)])  print(f"simpl_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 1): {simpl_g_subgraph.has_edge(1, 1)}") print(f"multi_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 1): {multi_g_subgraph.has_edge(1, 1)}") print(f"simpl_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 2): {simpl_g_subgraph.has_edge(1, 2)}") print(f"multi_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 2): {multi_g_subgraph.has_edge(1, 2)}") print(list(simpl_g_subgraph.edges(data=True))) print(list(multi_g_subgraph.edges(data=True, keys=True))) ``` output: ``` simpl_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 1): False multi_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 1): True simpl_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 2): False multi_g_subgraph has_edge (1, 2): False [(0, 1, {}), (3, 4, {})] [(0, 1, 0, {}), (3, 4, 0, {})] ``` ### Environment  Python version: 3.10.12 NetworkX version: 3.4.2
