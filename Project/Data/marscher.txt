DiGraph serialization (get/setstate) triggers an AttributeError for "_adj"#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> Passing a `DiGraph` to deepcopy uses the serialization protocol via get and set_state methods of `InEdgeView`. In the implementation there is an assignment to self._adj like this: ``` python  self._adjdict = G._pred if hasattr(G, "pred") else G._adj ``` So the passed `Graph` does not have the `_adj` attribute. By inspection I figured, that the state dictionary contains the `_adjdict` property directly. If I replace the code to set `_adjdict` from the state, everything works as expcted.  ### Expected Behavior Copying a `DiGraph` via deepcopy should work. This used to be the case for networkx<2.8.1  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ```python G = nx.MultiDiGraph() edges = G.in_edges() deepcopy(G) ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.8.1   ### Additional context A github action workflow triggering the error: <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/runs/6502339152?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:110  ``` python  File ~/micromamba/envs/weldx/lib/python3.8/site-packages/networkx/classes/reportviews.py:1290, in InEdgeView.__setstate__(self, state)    1288 def __setstate__(self, state):    1289     self._graph = G = state["_graph"] -> 1290     self._adjdict = G._pred if hasattr(G, "pred") else G._adj    1291     self._nodes_nbrs = self._adjdict.items  AttributeError: 'DiGraph' object has no attribute '_adj' ``` 
issue
[nx_pylab] fix StopIteration, if empty dict is passed for labels.#TITLE_END#The new detection for multi-edge labels raises, if an empty dict was passed. Before this detection that was fine, because the loop iterating over the passed labels just passed.  Added small test as well.  <!-- Please run black to format your code.
