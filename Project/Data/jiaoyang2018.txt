issues about the function 'preferential_attachment_graph' for bipartite networks#TITLE_END#Hi, when using the function of  'preferential_attachment_graph'  to generate  a random bipartite network, how to set the probability 'p'?  I have checked the journal paper,  'Jean-Loup Guillaume and Matthieu Latapy, Bipartite structure of all complex networks, Inf. Process. Lett. 90, 2004, pg. 215-221', which gives a formula to calculate 'p'. But I wonder if the 'p' is the ratio of number of nodes to the sum of the sizes of the cliques, not 1 minus the ratio.   Looking forward to your reply.
