issue
faulty gomory_hu method#TITLE_END#Hi,  it seems the implementation of gomory_hu is faulty: the computed tree is not necessarily a Gomory-Hu (cut) tree. Indeed, in the tree (bottom left) in the figure, the edge (2,3) indicates that {0,2} should give a smallest cut separating 2 from 3. The cut, however, contains four edges (unit weights) but the smallest cut, the edges incident with 2, has size 3. The tree at the bottom right should be a proper G-H tree.  ![gh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46501322/50855647-b4b8ca00-1388-11e9-83c0-8804b8b562d8.png)  The issue apparently stems from the fact that a couple of lines of the Gusfield algorithm have been omitted from the implementation in networkx. The lines that are missing are the last seven or so lines on page 152 in Gusfield's paper. I've attached a modified version of the gomory_hu method that should correct this (zipped). I've also attached a jupyter notebook that compares the current implementation with the fix (zipped). Note the weights computed by the nx.gomory_hu method seem okay -- it's only the tree that may be incorrect.   Caveat: I was too lazy to check that Gusfield's algorithm actually works.
