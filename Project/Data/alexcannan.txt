issue
Looking to iterate over subnetworks in graph#TITLE_END#Hi there, I'm trying to determine all the subnetworks in my graph, to omit ones less than 3 nodes large. I've searched through the documentation pretty extensively but can't find any functions that would do this. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to generate this? Ideally it would be a list of tuples containing all the nodes in each subgraph.  I'm currently trying to put something together that does this, by iterating over all nodes, and using the all_neighbors function with a list of sets. If something like this doesn't already exist, would a get_subnetworks() function be worth a PR?
