Deserializing custom default properties from yEd graphML files#TITLE_END#When importing a yEd created graphml file with custom properties on the  nodes I found that the default values for boolean properties was always True.  After some browsing through the code of GraphMLReader I found that while the properties of the nodes themselves are passed through the `decode_data_elements` method (so that GraphML booleans are parsed correctly), the items in the  node_default dictionary are not.   For the defaults, the value of each key is just cast to the appropriate `python_type` In the case of booleans with value='false' this results in `bool('false') == True`  :(   ### Expected Behavior The default attribute values should also be passed through `decode_data_elements`  ### Steps to Reproduce Make a yed graphml file with some custom node property of value 'boolean' with default 'false' import the file using GraphMLReader The resulting default node property has bool value True.  ### Environment Python version: Python 3.9.4 (default, Apr  6 2021, 11:23:37)  [Clang 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)] on darwin  NetworkX version: 2.5.1  ### Additional context As posted in google discussion group [https://groups.google.com/g/networkx-discuss/c/XbFTyx-PKqc/m/pD2_WAdYAQAJ](https://groups.google.com/g/networkx-discuss/c/XbFTyx-PKqc/m/pD2_WAdYAQAJ)
