problem with cycle_basis#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  Hello, I'm having problems using the function cycle_basis(G). It finds some of the basic cycles incorrectly - cycles of greater length are found (see picture).  ![bug](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/50073123/cc80801d-51fa-4460-a379-f0d58c266e9b)   ### Expected Behavior  I expected that there would be cycles: 11 - 12 - 22 22 - 12 - 21 22 - 21 - 16 20 - 1 - 18 15 - 2 - 20 5 - 4 - 15  But instead, cycles were found accordingly: [11, 12, 13, 19, 17, 14, 23, 9, 10] [22, 12, 13, 19, 17, 14, 23, 9] [22, 21, 14, 23, 9] [20, 1, 0, 13, 19] [15, 2, 1, 0, 13, 19] [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 13, 19, 17]  That is, it finds the first two vertices correctly, and then covers a larger cycle than necessary  ### Steps to Reproduce  I checked that all the edges are being passed correctly, so (as my opinion) the problem is in the function. The example from the image includes the following edges:  19 - 21 3 - 15 5 - 6 8 - 9 15 - 20 18 - 19 11 - 22 5 - 17 4 - 5 13 - 0 1 - 18 6 - 17 17 - 19 1 - 20 17 - 21 2 - 3 16 - 21 21 - 22 14 - 21 2 - 20 11 - 12 6 - 7 6 - 23 19 - 20 10 - 11 12 - 21 9 - 16 15 - 19 14 - 16 5 - 15 10 - 22 2 - 15 12 4 - 15 14 - 17 12 - 13 9 - 10 0 - 18 18 - 20 16 - 22 9 - 22 8 - 23 13 - 19 6 - 14 0 - 1 13 - 21 9 - 23 16 - 23 12 - 22 14 - 23 3 - 4 7 - 23 7 - 8  When creating it I used the following functions: self.G = nx.Graph() self.G.add_edges_from(self.E) cycles = nx.cycle_basis(self.G)  ### Environment  Python version: 3.11.5 NetworkX version: 3.2.1
