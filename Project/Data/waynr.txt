issue
discrepancy between documentation and implementation of nx_agraph.to_agraph function#TITLE_END#[Documentation](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/tutorial/tutorial.html#graph-attributes) says to add graph attribute I should do:  ``` >>> G = nx.Graph(day="Friday") >>> G.graph {'day': 'Friday'} ``` or ``` >>> G.graph['day']='Monday' >>> G.graph {'day': 'Monday'} ```  Yet based on [the code that converts to an `pygraphviz.AGraph`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/v1.11/networkx/drawing/nx_agraph.py#L140-L143) it seems like the following would be more appropriate: ``` >>> G = nx.Graph(graph={"day":"Friday"}) >>> G.graph['graph'] {'day': 'Friday'} ``` or ``` >>> G.graph['graph'] = dict() >>> G.graph['graph']['day']='Monday' >>> G.graph['graph'] {'day': 'Monday'} ```  This is actually how I have to construct my `nx.DiGraph` in order to end up with a `pygraphviz.AGraph` that actually includes the `label` attribute that I want to give it.
