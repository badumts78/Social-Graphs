Improve error message for removed `random_tree` function#TITLE_END#Closes #8104   This PR improves the developer experience when calling the removed `networkx.random_tree` function (removed in v3.4) by raising a clearer, more informative `AttributeError`.  ### ❌ Current behavior Accessing `networkx.random_tree` raises:  ``` AttributeError: module 'networkx' has no attribute 'random_tree' ```  Screenshot: ![before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ec70e2-ce78-482e-9891-2ff6ecf4b511)   This error message is not helpful for users upgrading from older versions or reading legacy code.  ---  ### ✅ Proposed behavior  Adds a module-level `__getattr__` in `networkx/__init__.py` that catches attempts to access `random_tree` and raises:  ``` AttributeError: `networkx.random_tree` was removed in version 3.4. Use `networkx.random_labeled_tree` instead. See: https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-3.5/release/release_3.4.html ```  Screenshot: ![after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e538a2ef-72fc-4dd1-ac84-c16c55c13ec4)   This change is minimal and does not affect any existing internal logic or runtime performance.  ---  Let me know if you'd like me to generalize this into a utility for future removals as well.

Improve error message for removed `random_tree` function in NetworkX ≥ 3.4#TITLE_END#### Summary  In NetworkX versions < 3.4, the function `networkx.random_tree` was available and widely used for generating random trees. From version 3.4 onward, this function has been **removed**, as per PRs [#7415](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7415) and [#7411](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7411).  However, trying to access it now results in a generic and confusing error:  ``` AttributeError: module 'networkx' has no attribute 'random_tree' ```  This error message is **not informative**, especially for users upgrading from older code or referencing existing tutorials or notebooks.  ---  ### Suggestion  I propose adding a small `__getattr__` fallback in `networkx/__init__.py` to raise a clearer message when someone tries to access the removed function.  Example:  ```python def __getattr__(name):     if name == "random_tree":         raise AttributeError(             "`networkx.random_tree` was removed in version 3.4. Use `networkx.random_labeled_tree` instead.\n"             "See: https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-3.5/release/release_3.4.html"         )     raise AttributeError(f"module 'networkx' has no attribute '{name}'") ```  This change would significantly improve developer experience when debugging legacy code or migrating projects from older versions.  Please let me know if you're open to this. I'm happy to open a PR for this right after!

@amcandio and @dschult are right.  @hyperforest although your code results in different partitions, it’s still reproducible in the sense that it consistently produces the same output for a given seed. In your example, loop always break on the 5th iteration.   In addition to the approach suggested by @dschult, @rossbar also suggested a simpler (and more conventional) alternative to use a fixed integer seed instead of a `RandomState` object. For example:  ```python random_state = 42 init_group = partition_graph(graph, seed=random_state)  for it in range(100):     group = partition_graph(graph, seed=random_state)      if group != init_group:         print(f'Broken in iter: {it}')         print('\nInit. group:')         print(init_group)         print('\nGroup:')         print(group) ```  @rossbar I guess you can be convinced that there's no problem :)
