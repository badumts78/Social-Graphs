`cycle_basis` broken#TITLE_END#I believe the result of `cycle_basis` for a simple 2x2 table grid graph is wrong.   the graph is like this: 9-1-2 |    |   | 8-3-4 |    |   | 7-5-6  ```  edges = [     (1,2),     (2,4),     (1,3),     (3,4),     (3,5),     (4,6),     (5,6),     (8,3),     (8,7),     (5,7),     (1,9),     (9,8) ]  # g.add_edge(1,2) g.add_edges_from(edges)  # nx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw(g)  cb = nx.cycle_basis(g)  print(cb)  # result: [[3, 8, 9, 1], [3, 5, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1], [3, 4, 6, 5]] ```  instead of [2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1], [1,2,4,3] should have been the answer, isn't it?
