issue
a small bug in eulerian.eulerize ?#TITLE_END#I think that there is a small bug in eulerian.eulerize: it needs to find a minimum weight perfect matching , and to do that use a maximum weight  matching algorithm replacing each weight w by its inverse 1/w, which is not the correct way It should  rather use matching.min_weight_matching , that correctly replace each weight w by C-w (where C is a constant  that make sure that the weight are positive)  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> G= nx.cycle_graph(18) G.add_edge(0,18) G.add_edge(18,19) G.add_edge(17,19) G.add_edge(4,20) G.add_edge(20,21) G.add_edge(21,22) G.add_edge(22,23) G.add_edge(23,24) G.add_edge(24,25) G.add_edge(25,26) G.add_edge(26,27) G.add_edge(27,28) G.add_edge(28,13) eulerize(G) return a multigraph with 10 additional edges while it should have added only 8. In this graph, odd degree vertices are :0,4,13,17.  distance(0,17)=1  distance(4,13)=9 distance(0,4)=distance(13,17)= 4  eulerize chose to double 10 edges, while  it should have doubled only 8, Indeed 8<10 but unfortunaly  1/4+1/4 is also smaller that 1+1/9
