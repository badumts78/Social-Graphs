issue
Road network junctions using g.degree()#TITLE_END#Hello,  I am attempting to generate road network junctions using NetworkX (g.degree()) and I am having some issues. The road junctions I am interested in are dead ends (junctions with a degree equal to 1) and intersections (3 or more segments).   Below is the script I am using to generate these junctions, however I've noticed that some junctions generated that should have a degree of 3 have been assigned a degree of 2. Junctions with a degree of 2 I am not interested in (for example, roads that create an "L" shape).  Is there any indication what may be causing this? I initially thought it might have to do with the graph not being connected exactly but that is not the case.  Any help or further information would be greatly appreciated!
