Hey, I am a TA in a course on network science that is being taught and some of the students are facing the exact same error with nx.draw(). The error seems to be in the random_state decorator only. I am wondering if someone can mention this to folks at conda and make sure the dependencies are met already.  ``` IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)  ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\utils\decorators.py in _random_state(func, *args, **kwargs)     395         try: --> 396             random_state_arg = args[random_state_index]     397         except TypeError as e:  IndexError: tuple index out of range  ``` I will try to work around this issue and let them know the appropriate steps, but it sometimes is difficult for kids who aren't very proficient in solving such problems to deal with dependencies problems.

Yes, I was planning to do the same. will do the same later today and get back to this forum. I have encountered this same error in 3 different machines in the last couple of days on fresh install of Anaconda Individual edition.

@MridulS Yeah It is definitely due to Fresh conda install pinning the modules. Networkx and Decorator versions are as mentioned below ``` 2.5 5.0.6 ``` Conda is not letting me update the version as well.  ``` (base) C:\Users\username> conda update decorator Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done Solving environment: /  Updating decorator is constricted by  - anaconda -> requires decorator==5.0.6=pyhd3eb1b0_0  If you are sure you want an update of your package either try `conda update --all` or install a specific version of the package you want using `conda install <pkg>=<version>  ```  Same issue with updating networkx obviously.   I removed networkx (this removes a lot of dependent packages including numpy, pandas,etc) And then installed networkx again this time to 2.6.2. And then it worked well.   If anyone wants to recreate. You can simply do a fresh install of Anaconda (Used windows for all 4 recreations).  Use this code to get the error:  ``` G=nx.Graph() nodes=[1,2,3,4,5] edges=[(1,2),(3,4),(4,5),(2,3),(5,1)] G.add_nodes_from(nodes) G.add_edges_from(edges) nx.draw(G,with_labels=True) plt.show()  ```   ``` --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last) ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\utils\decorators.py in _random_state(func, *args, **kwargs)     395         try: --> 396             random_state_arg = args[random_state_index]     397         except TypeError as e:  IndexError: tuple index out of range  The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:  NetworkXError                             Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-5-f21a0ac2d507> in <module>       4 G.add_nodes_from(nodes)       5 G.add_edges_from(edges) ----> 6 nx.draw(G,with_labels=True)       7 plt.show()  ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_pylab.py in draw(G, pos, ax, **kwds)     121         kwds["with_labels"] = "labels" in kwds     122  --> 123     draw_networkx(G, pos=pos, ax=ax, **kwds)     124     ax.set_axis_off()     125     plt.draw_if_interactive()  ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_pylab.py in draw_networkx(G, pos, arrows, with_labels, **kwds)     331      332     if pos is None: --> 333         pos = nx.drawing.spring_layout(G)  # default to spring layout     334      335     draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, **node_kwds)  ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\decorator.py in fun(*args, **kw)     229             if not kwsyntax:     230                 args, kw = fix(args, kw, sig) --> 231             return caller(func, *(extras + args), **kw)     232     fun.__name__ = func.__name__     233     fun.__doc__ = func.__doc__  ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\utils\decorators.py in _random_state(func, *args, **kwargs)     398             raise nx.NetworkXError("random_state_index must be an integer") from e     399         except IndexError as e: --> 400             raise nx.NetworkXError("random_state_index is incorrect") from e     401      402         # Create a numpy.random.RandomState instance  NetworkXError: random_state_index is incorrect ```  So, yeah removing and reinstalling networkx works but it removes a lot of other packages with it.

Commenting for anyone who face this problem.   This is an issue with conda freezing the versions of packages.   Safest way to handle this is  `conda update --all`  This solves the environment and updates most of the packages that conda can update to latest stable release without breaking the environment .   No need to open another issue for this. I guess people at anaconda will update this in later releases.
