create_degree_sequence should not silently rewrite degree values less than 0 or greater than n#TITLE_END#When `create_degree_sequence` transforms the output of `sfunction` into integer degree values, it automatically rewrites values to ensure that they all fall within [0, n]:  ``` python # round to integer values in the range [0,max_deg] seq=[min(max_deg, max( int(round(s)),0 )) for s in trialseq] ```  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/utils/random_sequence.py#L50-L51  This is dangerous behaviour as it may result in unintended correlations in the generated network -- which the user cannot anticipate because the correction has been done silently without even outputting a warning.  Consider e.g. constructing a graph whose degree values are drawn from a power-law distribution -- there will be an excess of nodes with degree n.  The appropriate way to correct values that fall outside of the acceptable bounds is surely to randomly re-sample them from the specified distribution, not to just rewrite them to the boundary values.  However, this kind of silent rewriting seems to me to be wrong even if it is done in a statistically correct way -- it is safer to put the onus on `sfunction` to return values within the correct bounds, and for `create_degree_sequence` to throw an error if it receives values that fall outside [0, n].
