@aparamon I've found another solver for linear_sum_assignement that seems to work a little bit faster, it's not much of a gain in a long term but at least is something.   https://github.com/jfrelinger/cython-munkres-wrapper  I wrote a wrapper that you can plug into your code to try it out: ``` def munkres_wrapper(C):         lsa_row_ind = []         lsa_col_ind = []         R = munkres(C.copy(order='C'))                 for i in xrange(R.shape[0]):             for j in xrange(R.shape[1]):                 if R[i, j]:                     lsa_row_ind.append(i)                     lsa_col_ind.append(j)          lsa_row_ind = np.array(lsa_row_ind, dtype=np.int)         lsa_col_ind = np.array(lsa_col_ind, dtype=np.int)                  return lsa_row_ind, lsa_col_ind ```  I'll let you know if I find a suboptimal algorithm. Thanks for your work!

@Silberschleier Would you care to share it with me? I've been looking for something like that these days, I need it for my MSc. thesis.  @aparamon You're welcome! I've been thinking that maybe it will be useful an option to limit the "time" or total traversal of the tree, I'm actually doing something like this with a timeout and using the partial result. I need to read the paper to understand the algorithm, but it will be useful since it could be a good approximation.

Just leaving here something for future reference: there is another approach called BSS-GED published 3 months ago that uses beam search, which is very close to the idea of A* but limiting the memory, it seems to be improving the search and thus the performance. This is the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.10305.pdf  It could be interesting to see if @aparamon implementation can be modified to match this strategy, probably I'm going to try to do it myself in a future.

@aparamon Did you try cloning / adding a remote with https instead of ssh?  For the remote you can do:  ``` git remote -v # check the remotes git remote rm origin # remove origin remote git remote add origin https://github.com/aparamon/networkx.git # add new origin git push -u origin master # set origin as default upstream for master ```

@jfbeaumont I'm running your code exactly as it is and I'm getting 2.0 always (actually I run it 1000 times with an script and got always the same), with and without the fix @aparamon is pointing at.  Maybe there's a bug in some dependency?  Are you running it with python2 or 3?

@jfbeaumont Does the use of Python2 achives the same result? (I'm using that version).  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/143359/34051823-b438cfb6-e19e-11e7-987d-89bf93090631.png)  If we're not taking in consideration the labels, the edit distance should be 2 (deleting the edge from D to E and adding and edge from B to E), I can't think in any good reason for returning a GED of 1. I'm not expert tho, @aparamon is the correct person to answer this.
