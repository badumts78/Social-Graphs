issue
About the order of the edges returned by the nx.connected_component_subgraphs#TITLE_END#`component = list(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(Gn_1))[1] list(component.edges())`  OUT：('4042123', '7097284'),  ('4072357', '7097284'),  ('5097796', '7097284'),  ('7703755', '7097284'),  ('7097284', '5567325'),  ('7097284', '6745586'),  ('7097284', '1602379'),  ('7097284', '1615579'),  ('7097284', '1593193'),  ('7097284', '1613458'),  When I build a network，and use connected_component_subgraphs try to output the edge of the connected subgraph，I found that the order of the nodes on both sides of the edge changes relative to the original data.  In the above output，the correct mapping should be like （‘7097284’，‘4042123’），but some of its output is wrong(One to four lines). So someone know how to solve this problem? Thx！
