Pickle problem for low memory graph#TITLE_END#Code snippet to reproduce the problem.  ``` python import networkx as nx  class ThinGraph(nx.Graph):     """Copied from docs"""     all_edge_dict={'weight': 1}     def single_edge_dict(self):         return self.all_edge_dict     edge_attr_dict_factory = single_edge_dict  def main():     graph = ThinGraph()     graph.add_edge(1, 2)     nx.write_gpickle(graph, 'test.gpickle')   if __name__ == '__main__':     main() ```  with the traceback as following  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "test.py", line 18, in <module>     main()   File "test.py", line 12, in main     nx.write_gpickle(graph, 'test.gpickle')   File "<decorator-gen-172>", line 2, in write_gpickle   File "/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 220, in _open_file     result = func(*new_args, **kwargs)   File "/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gpickle.py", line 70, in write_gpickle     pickle.dump(G, path, protocol) cPickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.instancemethod failed ```  Any ideas about how to solve this problem?
