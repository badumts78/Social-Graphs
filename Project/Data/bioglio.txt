Update harmonic centrality#TITLE_END#I propose a new version of harmonic centrality that exploits the method nx.single_target_shortest_path_length (form pull request #2418) to avoid reversing the graph.  Moreover, I made its signature similar to the other centrality algorithms, by adding "normalized" and "reverse", and by replacing "nbunch" (a container of nodes) with "u" (a single node).

Fix closeness centrality for DiGraphs#TITLE_END#Closeness centrality for a node u is calculated as C(u) = \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)}, that is the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path distances from all n-1 other nodes to u, but in closeness_centrality method it is implemented as the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path distances from u to all n-1 other nodes. For undirected graphs, using d(u,v) instead of d(v,u) is not a problem, but for directed graph it can produce totally different results. For this reason I have slightly modified the closeness centrality function, by using predecessors of a node instead of successors in case of undirected graph through the new method "single_target_shortest_path_length" added to the file _networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/unweighted.py_: for the sake of completeness, I have also added the function "single_target_shortest_path" to the same file.  I really appreciate any feedback, and please feel free to modify any line of code ;)
