Improve subgraph node iteration#TITLE_END#The show_nodes() filter creates a set from an iterable container. However, FilterAtlas will always traverse the entire node set, even though the set of nodes is available in this newly constructed set.  This change dramatically speeds up node iteration when the subgraph is much smaller than the graph.  I tested this with the following: ``` import networkx as nx  import time  # Make a large graph GRAPH_SIZE=10000000  nodes = list(range(GRAPH_SIZE)) G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from(nodes)  # Make a small subgraph of the graph SG = G.subgraph(nodes[:100])  # Make a list of nodes from the subgraph t = time.clock() node_list = list(SG) elapsed = time.clock() - t  print('Time to make subgraph node list: {:.3f}'.format(elapsed)) ```  Our use case in particular involved created lists of nodes from connected component subgraphs of a large graph, which became much slower when upgrading to 2.0. This returns the performance to the levels we saw with 1.X.
