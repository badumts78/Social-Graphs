> I'm inclined to close this one and focus on the work in #8024 if for no other reason than we managed to hammer out the API through extensive discussions in that PR. WDYT @akshitasure12 ?  Hi @rossbar, @dschult, and @akshitasure12--just want to mention that I'm still 100% planning on finishing up PR #8024. It's just been a hectic few weeks. Hoping to resume discussion and finish up the remaining tasks for sure.  @akshitasure12, do take a look and let us know if you agree with the current plan for the API refactor going forward.
