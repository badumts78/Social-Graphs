issue
Error exporting Graph with write_shp#TITLE_END#Hello,  I am trying to export my graph using the write_shp function.  My graph contains nodes and edges. The nodes have the following attributes: {'loc': (406314.08793068246, 5757058.536303686)} The edges have the following attributes: {'coord': {'startEast': 404345.15315909754, 'startNorth': 5755594.779988128, 'endEast': 404334.2216339487, 'endNorth': 5755595.912515098}, 'dist': 18.51}  When I use this Graph in the function write_shp, I get the following error:   > NotImplementedError: Wrong number or type of arguments for overloaded function 'Feature_SetField'.   Possible C/C++ prototypes are:     OGRFeatureShadow::SetField(int,char const *)     OGRFeatureShadow::SetField(char const *,char const *)     OGRFeatureShadow::SetField(int,double)     OGRFeatureShadow::SetField(char const *,double)     OGRFeatureShadow::SetField(int,int,int,int,int,int,float,int)     OGRFeatureShadow::SetField(char const *,int,int,int,int,int,float,int)  If I comment out the lines using the setField() method, everything works. I know it is most likely an issue with ogr, but I thought that maybe someone here experienced something similar.   Are my graph attributes formatted wrong?
