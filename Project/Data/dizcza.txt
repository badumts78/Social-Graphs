spring_layout: ignore 'fixed' nodes not in the graph nodes#TITLE_END#This pull request addresses the issue when `fixed` nodes passed to the `spring_layout` function are not in the original graph nodes. The current behavior: an unintuitive error is shown.  ### Steps to reproduce  ```python import networkx as nx  graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_nodes_from([1]) pos = {n: (0, 1) for n in [1, 2]}  nx.spring_layout(graph, fixed=[1, 2], pos=pos) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<input>", line 7, in <module>   File "<decorator-gen-736>", line 2, in fruchterman_reingold_layout   File "/home/dizcza/miniconda3/envs/networkx/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 408, in _random_state     return func(*new_args, **kwargs)   File "/home/dizcza/miniconda3/envs/networkx/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py", line 461, in fruchterman_reingold_layout     fixed = np.asarray([nfixed[node] for node in fixed])   File "/home/dizcza/miniconda3/envs/networkx/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py", line 461, in <listcomp>     fixed = np.asarray([nfixed[node] for node in fixed]) KeyError: 2  ```  You may argue that the fix could be another raise error statement, however, it wouldn't be convenient because the user thinks in the following way: "`pos` dict can be a subset of the original nodes as well as it can have keys that are not in the original nodes. Therefore, I expect `fixed` parameter to behave in a similar manner."
