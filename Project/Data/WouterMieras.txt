traveling_salesman_problem fails when including edges with weight 0#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> The result of solving the traveling salesman problem should be a route that visits each node exactly once. When including edges of weight 0 it seems that applying the various TSP algorithms in networkx can give a route that visits some nodes more than once. Using edges with weight 0 is a valid use-case: for example to model routes with a fixed start node and end node or when it is not desired or necessary to return to the start node at the end of the route.  ### Current Behavior When adding edges with weight 0 to a Graph `nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem()` (and other TSP algorithms in networkx!) can give a route in which nodes are visited more than once.  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior Appying  `nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem()` on any Graph should output a route in which each node is visited exactly once.  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ``` import networkx as nx  graph = nx.Graph()  # simple graph with 3 nodes graph.add_edge(1,2,weight=1.0) graph.add_edge(2,3,weight=1.0) graph.add_edge(1,3,weight=1.0)  # add dummy node 4 which has distance 0 to all other nodes graph.add_edge(4,1,weight=0.0) graph.add_edge(4,2,weight=0.0) graph.add_edge(4,3,weight=0.0)  # result:  [1, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1] # this is unexpected, node 4 should be visited only once. result = nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem(graph, nodes=[1,2,3,4], cycle=True) ``` ### Environment     <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10.4 NetworkX version: 2.8.8 (also tested with 3.0)  ### Additional context As a workaround I've used the `python_tsp` library which deals with 0-edges correctly <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
