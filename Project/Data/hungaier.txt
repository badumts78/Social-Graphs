issue
Bug: can not match subgraph when the target graph has triple rings.#TITLE_END#Case:  ``` import networkx g = networkx.Graph() g.add_edges_from( [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4)])  subg= networkx.Graph() subg.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)])  gm = networkx.algorithms.isomorphism.GraphMatcher(g, subg) print(gm.is_isomorphic()) ```   The result is False. But subg is exactraly the sub graph of g.   I temporarily fix the bug by changing code in networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/isomorphvf2.py:458 as follow (version:1.11 , but higher versions also have the same bug): ``` #..... for neighbor in self.G1[G1_node]:     if neighbor in self.core_1:         if not (self.core_1[neighbor] in self.G2[G2_node]):             if len(set(self.G1[G1_node]) & set(self.G1[neighbor])) == 0:#fix bug for triple ring                 return False             neighbor_set = set(self.G2[G2_node]) & set(self.core_2.keys()) &\                            set([self.core_1[n]  for n in self.G1[G1_node] if n in self.core_1 ])             if not (neighbor_set and (neighbor_set == (set(self.G2[G2_node])) & set(self.core_2.keys()))):                 return False        # ..... ```  Does it have a better way to fix this issue?
