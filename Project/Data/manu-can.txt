Stop searching the graph when reaching the target node#TITLE_END#Hi NetworkX developers,  while using the function all_shortest paths, I noticed, that the parameter 'target' is not passed through to the inner functions. This means, that the query v == target in the inner-most function is never True and the whole graph is being searched every time (without breaking when the target is reached).  I fixed it only for weighted graphs and tested it on my computer, where the fix seems to improve computation time, especially for strongly connected graphs.   This is my first pull request, so please let me know, if I need to change or add anything!
