Code and tests for temporal VF2#TITLE_END#This feature is a directed and undirected extension to the DiGraphMatcher and GraphMatcher classes, respectively. The returned isomorphic embeddings capture temporal information in the graph, assuming the edges have a "date" or "datetime" attribute.  Both incorporate a temporal constraint: timedelta "d". All interactions adjacent to a node must happen within time "d" of each other. In the directed case, all incoming interactions must precede all outgoing interactions.  This work was part of my PhD research at University College Dublin. Citation: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2492586 Paper available on request.
