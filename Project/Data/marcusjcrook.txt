issue
code and doc fix for square_clustering algorithm in cluster.py#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> Peng et al. propose a modification of the clustering coefficient based on the work of Pedro G. Lind et al. On page 3, They give a counterexample that shows the equation by Lind et al. gives the incorrect number of squares for a particular graph.  Basically it boils down to changing this code:  potential += (len(G[u]) - degm) * (len(G[w]) - degm) + squares  to this:  potential += (len(G[u]) - degm) + (len(G[w]) - degm) + squares   I also updated the documentation and the unit tests (and added a new unit test).
