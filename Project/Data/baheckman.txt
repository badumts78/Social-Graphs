replace induced_subgraph example with directly relevant example#TITLE_END#Closes #5566   Adding a more directly relevant example for induced_subgraph method. 
issue
induced_subgraph docs show unrelated example#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> The example on the documentation for induced_subgraph [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.induced_subgraph.html) shows an example of a generic subgraph function, not the induced_subgraph function.   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> Currently the doc page in question does not show an example of the function it is documenting in the example. It shows an example of the `subgraph()` method, instead of the `induced_subgraph()` method. Perhaps this is for a reason, but it seems wrong.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> I expect the documentation example to show an example using the function being documented (in this case a call to the induced_subgraph function somewhere on this page).  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.7 NetworkX version: 2.8   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> 
comment
Is the `@not_implemented_for("multigraph")` needed for any of the LCA algorithms? According to the docs, these functions should work on any non-null DAG, which can include a MultiDiGraph.  A previous change refactored the decorator from `@not_implemented_for("multigraph", "undirected")` to the current setting [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2603). However, I think this should only need the `@not_implemented_for("undirected")` decorator. This would also throw an exception for a Multigraph, but allow MultiDiGraph to work as expected.   If that's the case, I'm happy to file a PR for this one. If not then apologies for the noise here!
