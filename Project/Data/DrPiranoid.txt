Hi All,  @ogreen  is correct that the original definition was a k-truss is the induced subgraph from edges which are part of (k-2) or more triangles. I cited that paper in the references as well. It's likely Cohen chose that definition so that the k-clique was a k-truss. (This would have to be changed in this PR documentation to be consistent.)  I chose a different convention because i think the k-2 confuses things. This convention is followed in the first reference I cited. I think this notation gives a better understanding of the thing being counted - triangles.  For example the triangle is a 1-truss in my notation and a 3-truss in Cohen's. With that in mind they're otherwise identical.  Either way you decide we should expand the docstring to make the convention more explicit. My description is correct but very terse and doesn't acknowledge the other convention.  Let me know what you decide.
