Only compute shortest path lengths when used#TITLE_END#### What's done?  This PR adds a branch in `common_neighbor_centrality` to introduce a simple performance optimization. Computing `nx.shortest_path_length(G)` is extremely computationally expensive, so we should avoid this call, especially if the corresponding result isn't used.  ### Rationale When `alpha = 1`, the expression:   ```python (1 - alpha) * (G.number_of_nodes() / path_len) ``` evaluates to 0.  As such, `path_len`, and consequently `spl` aren't being used.  `alpha = 1` is a common enough configuration for the parameter that I feel this optimization is justified. The tradeoff is between the complexity of the newly introduced code and the performance benefit of avoiding computing shortest path legnths.  I believe the tradeoff has a clear winner.  ### Approach  This PR tries to avoid the computationally expensive call to generate all shortest path lengths when `alpha = 1` to improve performance of the call.  I'm not a seasoned Python developer, so I'm open to making this change more _Pythonic_.  <!-- Please run black to format your code.
