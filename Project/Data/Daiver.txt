[Feature proposal] Iterator which traverses graph by neighbors "rings"#TITLE_END#Hello! First of all I'm sorry for my possible English mistakes (I'm not a native speaker)  Recently I faced the need of iterator which will traverse graph by "neighbors rings" (I'm not sure how to name it right) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55939790/networkx-traverse-graph-by-waves I've created a simple iterator which performs such king of traversing, for example: ```python >>> g = nx.Graph() >>> g.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)]) >>> list(traverse_rings(g, source=0, depth_limit=None)) [[1, 2], [3, 4]]] ``` I can create a PR but i have 2 questions: 1) Does networkx need such an algorithm? 2) Which name is appropriate for such kind of algorithm?  This is an implementation: ```python def traverse_rings(graph: nx.Graph, source, depth_limit=None):     """docs are omitted for simplicity """     # Complex graphs are not supported now     assert not graph.is_directed()     assert not graph.is_multigraph()      depth_limit = depth_limit if depth_limit is not None else graph.number_of_nodes()      visited_nodes = {source}     current_ring = [source]     next_ring = []      current_depth = 0     while current_depth < depth_limit and len(current_ring) > 0:         for current_node in current_ring:             neighbourhood = graph.neighbors(current_node)             for neighbour in neighbourhood:                 if neighbour not in visited_nodes:                     next_ring.append(neighbour)                     visited_nodes.add(neighbour)         if len(next_ring) > 0:             yield next_ring         current_depth += 1         current_ring = next_ring         next_ring = [] ```  Also i have ~10 unittests which can be easily transformed to `nose`
