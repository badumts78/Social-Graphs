issue
numeric assortativity coefficient only works for nonnegative numeric attributes#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  If the range of numeric attributes ranges from negative to positive (and not all negative), `nx.numeric_mixing_matrix` effectively disregards it since it is generated using `mapping = {x: x for x in range(m + 1)}`.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> The negative integers should be included in generating the matrix. Alternatively: 1. just use the Pearson correlation coefficient as given in Peel et al, eq. S4-S5 (Leto Peel, Jean-Charles Delvenne, Renaud Lambiotte, Multiscale mixing patterns in networks, PNAS Apr 2018, 115 (16) 4057-4062; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1713019115). This has the added benefit that the scalar quantities need not be integers. 2. require that the integers be nonnegative 3. increase the size of the matrix so it includes the negative integers as well.    ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from([1,2], a=-1) G.add_nodes_from([3], a=1) G.add_nodes_from([4], a=2) G.add_edges_from([(3,4),(1,2),(1,3)]) # numeric_assortativity_coefficient gives -1.0 print(nx.numeric_assortativity_coefficient(G, 'a')) ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.5   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
