Fix issues with urls in HITS reference docs#TITLE_END#This is a small PR to address a couple of issues I found in the references section of the HITS algorithm documentation.  1. The link for the first reference was broken. I've updated it to point to a live webpage with a pdf of the paper. 2. The link for the second reference was not being rendered by sphinx as a url. I reordered it with the doi information to get sphinx to recognize it as a link. 3. Lastly, I switch both urls to use `https`.

Remove unused import in convert_matrix.py (networkx.utils.not_implemented_for)#TITLE_END#This is a single line modification - it just removes a no longer used import.

BiRank Algorithm Implementation#TITLE_END#This pull request adds an implementation of the [BiRank algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04396) to networkx under `networkx.algorithms.bipartite.link_analysis`, as proposed in #7963. It attempts to match the api patterns found in similar algorithms, like those found under `networkx.algorithms.bipartite.centrality`, as closely as possible.  Additionally, two unit tests have been added to ensure code coverage.  While the code is document to the standards set out by the contribution guidelines, I am considering adding additional context to the introduction to better explain when/what it should be used for.   If this seems like something worth moving forward with, I would like to make sure the my choices of input validation (ensuring `alpha` and `beta` have valid values, and ensuring there exists at least one node in the top and bottom sets) and Exception type (`nx.NetworkXAlgorithmError`) are inline with networkx conventions. I see some algorithms raise a generic `NetworkXError`- and I'm not sure if this the preference or not.

Add sg_execution_times.rst to gitignore#TITLE_END#When running the `make` command to build the docs locally, the file `sg_execution_times.rst` is created. I've added it to the `.gitignore` for convenience/QoL.

Added ability to specify the mass of a node individually when using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm#TITLE_END#Added an optional input argument, `node_weight` to `spring_layout`. Given a string that is a node property this will treat it as the mass of the node for the purposes of calculating the anti-gravity force used in `spring_layout`. If none is given, it will continue to calculate it in the default manner.   I find that when drawing certain graphs with large variations in the degrees of member nodes it is helpful for low-degree nodes to tend towards the edge of the drawing. This results in the high-degree nodes being pulled apart from each other as they are dragged along by their low-degree nodes, making the graph more readable.  For example, compare the two drawings of `G` here. ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.hypercube_graph(5) for node in G:   G.nodes[node]['node_weight'] = 1  same_mass = nx.drawing.fruchterman_reingold_layout(G, node_weight='node_weight', seed=1)  G.nodes[(0,0,0,0,0)]['node_weight'] = 100 dif_mass = nx.drawing.fruchterman_reingold_layout(G, node_weight='node_weight', seed=1)  nx.draw(G, pos=same_mass, with_labels=False) nx.draw(G, pos=dif_mass, with_labels=False) ```

Standardize documentation for `nodes` argument#TITLE_END#Uses standardized phrase "iterable of nodes" for describing the argument type of nodes/top_nodes.  See #7990 for rational behind this change.

Question: Should we include networkx as a import outside of the standard library for autoflake to check when the hook is run? Are there any other imports we should check?

Small suggestion for the sketch of the  `pathlist` class - `pred[u]` is a list of potentially more than 1 predecessor. So I think it should be `current = pred.get(current)[0]` instead of `current = pred.get(current)`.

> I’ve encountered a couple of issues with the tests in my PR, specifically in the doctest for the `networkx.generators.lattice.hypercube_graph` function. The test is failing with the following error message: test/default. i would appreciate if anyone ackonwledge me about this  Try running the commands from the example in your local python interpreter. Ensure that, when run in order, each command executes successfully, and that their output exactly matches what is given in the example.

Hey @ishrathtahaseen-9 - don't worry about the failed test due to a missing label - that's normal, and the maintainers will add an appropriate label when they get around to reviewing your PR.  One thing that you could address in the meantime is making sure you're passing all the unit test checks. You can find a setup guide [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/developer/contribute.html#testing) for running the tests locally.
