+1 this issue/PR. Adding lastmodified as a tag does not allow me to import the GEXF file into Cytoscape (with gexf-app). Changing it to lastmodifieddate as attribute fixed it for me.  For the time being, I just patched the function as below in my local file (~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py) [Ubuntu 18.04 / Python 3.6.8 x64 / installed via pip3]  ``` def add_meta(self, G, graph_element):         # add meta element with creator and date         meta_element = Element('meta', lastmodifieddate = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))         SubElement(meta_element, 'creator').text = 'NetworkX {}'.format(nx.__version__)         graph_element.append(meta_element)` ```  Would appreciate a merge so others can profit from the fix. But yeah, for the time being I just patched it this way :man_shrugging:
