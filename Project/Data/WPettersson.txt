Maximally matchable edges#TITLE_END#Given a graph G, let the maximally matchable edges E be the set of edges e such that for any maximum matching M of G, e is an element of M.  That is, E contains all edges that are in every maximum matching of G.   I've come into a position where I want to know this set of edges as part of a reduction I'm working on. The lazy way of doing this is to find a maximum matching M, and then for every edge e in M, create G' = G\e, run the maximum matching algorithm on G' and if the new maximum matching is smaller then e is in the set of maximally matchable edges. This is also still polynomial time.  However, this process can be slow, if we have to reconstruct all the blossoms and other data structures. The faster way is hopefully to this edge checking within the `networkx.algorithms.max_weight_matching` function, before the associated data structures are deleted, but I'm still reading through the details on this particular implementation of the maximum weight matching algorithm. I'm used to Edmond's approach but the dual is something I've never studied in detail.  Is this something that might be a useful addition? And does anyone have any hints/tips, either on the algorithm itself or on the new function name/code layout or anything?
