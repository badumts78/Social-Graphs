Faster Implementation of Structural Holes#TITLE_END#Use sparse matrices to compute constraints and effective sizes fast.  Usually researchers would like to obtain structural hole measures for **all** nodes in a social network. This process can be really slow with current implementation of `networkx`.   Current algorithm can be accelerated with matrix operations. The constraints can be calculated as row sums of elementwise square of $$P+P^2,$$ where $P = (p_{ij})$ is the matrix of (sum-)normalized mutual weights. Similarly, the effective sizes can be calculated as row sums of $E-PM^T$, where $E$ is the matrix of ones and $M = (m_{ij})$ is the matrix of (max-)normalized mutual weights. Mutual weights can be calculated simply to the sum of adjacency matrix and its transpose.  Experiments show that the efficiency gain is large. For Erdos-Renyi network with $n=1000$ and $p=0.1$, algorithm based on matrix operations can be over 100 times faster than current implementation.  The matrix-based algorithm calculates structural hole measures for all nodes at once. I maintain the original algorithm if the user only wants to obtain structural hole measures only for a few nodes.  <!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code.
