issue
Further improvements to strategy_saturation_largest_first#TITLE_END#Function fails when vertices are colored between iterations. For example, if one wanted to use DSATUR to color every other vertex, and some other mechanism to color the others, the function would fail because the number of iterations would be wrong. The function now iterates until all vertices are colored (rather than for a fixed number of steps).
issue
strategy_saturation_largest_first now accepts partial colorings#TITLE_END#Amended functionality of strategy_saturation_largest_first so that the colors input can now be a partial coloring. This is so that the coloring of a partially-colored graph - in which the partial coloring is valid (the new code checks this) - can be completed using DSATUR. This reflects the functionality described in the docstring: ``` ``colors`` is a dictionary mapping nodes of ``G`` to colors, for those nodes that have already been colored.  ``` See the discussion of this issue here: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5884  There is also a test that checks (on two graphs) that if a partial coloring (of i nodes) matches the color assignments of the first i nodes given by the application of DSATUR to the uncolored graph, then the completed colorings also match.
