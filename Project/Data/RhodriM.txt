Slightly related, not sure if needs own issue: currently networkx doesn't seem to allow for multiple nodes with the same label. I don't see anything in the standard that states that the node label should be unique, only the id. I've used other tools (eg gephi etc) with gml that allow multiple nodes to have the same label. (to me the term 'label' itself doesn't imply a unique identifier, whereas 'id' certainly does).  Currently this is precluding me from using networkx with some other systems which use gml - but that doesn't mean networkx is at fault of course! Which is wrong? Should node labels for gml (or other file formats) be unique, or not?    A related stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43196192/networkx-allow-duplicate-node-labels
