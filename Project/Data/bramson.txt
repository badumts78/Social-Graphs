issue
An undirected 'Graph' object has no attribute 'all_neighbors', but the docs imply it should.#TITLE_END#<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> When I try `neigh = G.all_neighbors(node)` on an undirected Graph, the console informs me  `AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute 'all_neighbors'`  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen --> The documentation says "If the graph is directed returns predecessors as well as successors."   The documentation **DOES NOT** say that it _only_ works for directed networks.  If it only works on directed graphs, there would be no reason to specify "if the graph is directed" in the docs. The wording therefore implies that it works on undirected networks. However, the documentation **DOES NOT** say what _should_ happen for undirected networks. I expected it would report the same thing as `G.neighbors(n)` when applied to an undirected Graph object.  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from([2, 3]) neigh = G.all_neighbors(2) ``` ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version:  3.11.7 NetworkX version: 3.2.1 
issue
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' from greedy_modularity_communities() in v2.6.2#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> I have an undirected, weighted network and I am trying to run greedy_modularity_communities() on it.  This morning I had NetworkX v2.5 and it worked great with 'weight=None' or one of my edgeWeights , but I couldn't use the resolution parameter.  So, I updated my networkx, and now when I run the algorithm, I get a TypeError in a weird place no matter what the parameters are.  ### Current Behavior ```   File "...\networkMeasureScoring_v3.py", line 1511, in <module>     communitiesModularity = list(community.greedy_modularity_communities(thisNetwork, weight=edgeWeight, resolution=thisGamma))    File "...\networkx\algorithms\community\modularity_max.py", line 93, in greedy_modularity_communities     dq_dict = {    File "...\networkx\algorithms\community\modularity_max.py", line 94, in <dictcomp>     i: {    File "...\networkx\algorithms\community\modularity_max.py", line 95, in <dictcomp>     j: 2 * q0 * G.get_edge_data(i, j).get(weight, 1.0)  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' ```  ### Expected Behavior  I expect it to output a list of lists of nodes, like it did under v2.5. When I run the example from the documentation it works: ``` from networkx.algorithms.community import greedy_modularity_communities G = nx.karate_club_graph() c = list(greedy_modularity_communities(G)) print(sorted(c[0])) ``` So, presumably it's due to some feature of my network, but... without changing the network, this worked with networkX v2.5, but fails in v2.6  ### Steps to Reproduce Run  `communitiesModularity = list(community.greedy_modularity_communities(thisNetwork, weight=edgeWeight, resolution=thisGamma))` on some thisNetwork for any edgeWeight and any thisGamma.  Actually, I get the same error nor running just  `communitiesModularity = list(community.greedy_modularity_communities(thisNetwork))` on my network, so it has nothing to do with the weight or resolution parameters  My interpretation is that either G doesn't have the edge (i,j) at this point. It shouldn't fail to get edge data of any edge (i,j) that should be in the input graph (by construction). I mean, all the i and j elements are pulled from G, so, how could it not exist? Could it have been removed from G during the modularity maximization processes. Would that happen if i doesn't have any neighbors? I've isolated the largest component of my network, so initially all nodes have at least one neighbor.  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8.10 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, May 11 2021, 06:25:23) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] NetworkX version: 2.6.2   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> Like I said, it shouldn't matter, but the network is a road network extracted from Open Street Map.
