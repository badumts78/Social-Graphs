issue
A bug with networkx.algorithms.covering#TITLE_END#Judging from the documentation it has to return the edges in both directions (i.e. (v,u)  and (u,v)). But as it is implemented it sometimes return both the directions and sometimes only once. In the implementation an initial set is created by "nx.max_weight_matching" which gives only ONE direction and then for every remaining uncovered node an edge is added in BOTH directions. So  for example for the simple graph : [('1','A'),('1','B')] it will return: {('1', 'A'), ('A', '1'), ('1', 'B')} (and the right should be {('1', 'A'), ('A', '1'), ('1', 'B'),('B','1')})
