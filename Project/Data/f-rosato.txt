Lukes algorithm implementation#TITLE_END#Introduces the Lukes optimal tree partitioning algorithm in networkx.algorithms.community. This algorithm partitions a tree with float weighted edges and integer weighted nodes, in such a way that the total node weight of the block does not exceed a maximum size and the edge cuts are minimum. It is an exact algorithm and it runs in pseudo-polynomial time.  Reference: Lukes, J. A. (1974). Efficient Algorithm for the Partitioning of Trees.

Sparse fruchterman needs t scaled by domain size#TITLE_END#Unlike the regular version of fruchterman reingold, the sparse version doesn't calculate temperature proportionality to domain size. I propose to make the exact same calculation for t in the sparse version, too. If this calculation is not carried out, unsatisfying behavior is shown when plotting graphs with nodes with fixed, faraway position.
