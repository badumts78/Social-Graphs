To quote from another repo:  > It seems like it's just an issue of the ambiguity of the word "weight". The word "weight" just means a number. It doesn't necessarily mean that a higher weight is better or stronger; that depends on the context.  Ultimately, I think this comes down to a clarity of documentation issue.  Because the word "weight" is inherently ambiguous, each algorithm that uses the word should provide an explicit definition in its documentation.  Regardless of whether you've read the literature or not, it can be a usability issue in a lib if the parameters aren't clear.  It's easy to forget, and it's easy to make a mistake generally because "weight" is so ambiguous.  I'll be updating the documentation for Cytoscape.js to clarify things.  I think making the documentation clearer for tools like Cytoscape.js and NetworkX is the only reasonable approach to this issue.  It's not practical to try to make every weight for every algorithm have the same semantics, especially since consistency with the literature is very important --- in my opinion, anyway.
