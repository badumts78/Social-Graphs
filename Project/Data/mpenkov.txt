issue
networkx is unable to display some unicode characters#TITLE_END#I'm trying to draw a graph using Japanese characters. I've set up a Japanese font, and _most_ characters display OK. There are some characters, however, that display as a box with an X inside of it. It doesn't seem to be a font problem, because in that case, I'd be seeing a box _without_ an X inside of it.  Reproducing the problem is a little bit involved, so I did it in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mpenkov/heisig/blob/master/nx-font-problem.ipynb).  The notebook shows three nodes:  1. Japanese character, font configured properly, displays OK (expected). 2. Japanese character, font _not_ configured properly, displays box _without_ an X (expected) 3. **Japanese character, font configured properly, displays box _with_ an X (unexpected)**  How can I get that third character to display correctly?  Many thanks!
