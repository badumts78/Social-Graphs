Fix degree_assortativity_coefficient for directed graphs#TITLE_END#This PR fixes #4998 by correcting the degree mapping for directed graphs in order to compute the assortativity properly with ``degree_assortativity_coefficient``.

Wrong degree_assortativity_coefficient for directed graphs#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior ``degree_assortativity_coefficient`` will fail for most directed graphs except if the set of in- or out-degrees is the same as the set of total-degrees. This issue was introduced in 2.6 by #4928 ([L78](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4928/files#diff-76675aa4f0d3a79d394219c8e15ec346b3f5af9f4a733d5ef9e7026421d43bd9R78)).  ### Expected Behavior The mapping should include all relevant in- and out-degrees for directed graphs.  ### Steps to Reproduce ```python G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from([(0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2)])  nx.degree_assortativity_coefficient(G)  # returns NaN nx.degree_pearson_correlation_coefficient(G)  # returns the correct value 0.14852 ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.9 NetworkX version: 2.6+
