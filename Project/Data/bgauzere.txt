Hi, @jfbeaumont  contacted us about some code source to compute graph edit distance (ged). Hopefully, we  developed many methods, essentially to approximate ged. We organized a contest (https://gdc2016.greyc.fr/) and we have now a clear view on pros and cons of several methods, including the one implemented by @aparamon. I started to write some python code to implement these methods (here: https://git.litislab.fr/bgauzere/py-graph/tree/master/pygraph/ged) and also some graph kernels (other graph similarity measure). How may I include this code to networkX ? I need to fork the main repo, commit my proposals and ask for a merge ?
