issue
networkx.readwrite.edgelist.read_weighted_edgelist seems to scramble edge start and end nodes#TITLE_END#I created a .csv file with weighted edges using nx.readwrite.edgelist.write_weighted_edgelist(G, csvfile, delimiter = ',' ). That worked perfectly, but if I try to read that same file some of the edges have their nodes swapped. And not all edges are read  I used the following code: G1 = nx.DiGraph() with open('./Edges.csv', 'rb') as f:     G1 = nx.readwrite.edgelist.read_weighted_edgelist(f, delimiter=',')    If I print(G1.edges) not only are half the edges missing but as said some nodes are scrambled. I appended my full test file to replicate the issue. Commented out is also the code to create the same .csv file I am using. I am using python 3.8 on a WSL ( Ubuntu 20) in a virtual environment with networkx 2.5  [test6.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/5825700/test6.zip)
