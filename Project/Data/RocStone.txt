In short, after I get a flowDict, how can I know it's value easily?#TITLE_END#using this `mincostFlow = nx.max_flow_min_cost(G, 9506, 9505)`  I can get a flowDict of min cost max flow of G, now I want to know it's flow value I searched the inference of networkx, I found this function `value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 9506, 9505)`  but i think if there exists a function can count the flows of `mincostFlow` should be faster than `nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 9506, 9505)` right?  **In short, after I get a flowDict, how can I know it's value easily?** **this lib is awesome, thanks for your work, wish you happy every day.**
