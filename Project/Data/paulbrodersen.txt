Building the documentation requires additional dependencies beyond what is specified in doc/README.md#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  The documentation for the building the documentation only instructs to install the additional dependencies in `requirements/doc.txt`.

Implemented proper arrows.#TITLE_END#The main challenge in this task was to ensure a consistent scaling of draw elements (nodes, node edges, edges, and arrow heads). Matplotlib has 3 different scales / length units (figure, axis and data) and different draw elements are tied to different scales. In the previous implementation draw elements with different scales were mixed (c.f. node_size=300 but linewidth=1.), making it impossible to design a decent layout a priori, and in particular to choose sensible values for arrow heads and arrow head offsets to prevent occlusion by/of nodes. In this new implementation, all draw elements are derived from matplotlib.patches, and are hence of uniform scale (c.f. node_size=3. and linewidth=0.5). As far as I can tell, the only compatibility breaking change was to scrap the draw_networkx_edges() argument 'style', as there is no equivalent in the matplotlib.patches class.
