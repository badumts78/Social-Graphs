issue
read_edgelist using a file handle fails in python3#TITLE_END#I am reading in a network from a file as follows using networkx 2.3.  with open('network.edgelist', 'r') as fh:     my_network = nx.read_edgelist(fh)  This still works in python2 but switching to python3 throws up an error based on the use of "line.decode(encode) on line 366 of "networkx/readwrite/edgelist.py". (Full error message below).  The line in question is:  "line.decode(encoding) for line in path"   This is based on a change in python3, where the string is already decoded, so has no ".decode" attribute.  Deleting ".decode(encoding)" resolved the problem for me and the edgelist file is read correctly.  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "script.py", line 33, in <module>     yeast_network = nx.read_edgelist(fh)   File "</home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/decorator.py:decorator-gen-584>", line 2, in read_edgelist   File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 240, in _open_file     result = func_to_be_decorated(*new_args, **kwargs)   File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/edgelist.py", line 369, in read_edgelist     data=data)   File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/edgelist.py", line 250, in parse_edgelist     for line in lines:   File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/edgelist.py", line 366, in <genexpr>     lines = (line.decode(encoding) for line in path) AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'
