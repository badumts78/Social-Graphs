issue
Const'ifying utils.reversed?#TITLE_END#I was surprised that `nx.utils.reversed` is modifying its argument instead of returning a reversed view of it, which would keep the argument unmodified.  Current: ```py with nx.utils.reversed(G):    ... ```  Proposed: ```py with nx.utils.reversed(G) as G_: # or another name like reversed_view...    ... ```  Context: I didn't expect `nx.ancestors(dg, n)` to modify `dg` and was calling it from several threads and descendants were returned sometimes. Found the problem and now I'm using a view per thread, nevertheless IMO it would be cleaner if free functions weren't unexpectedly modifying their arguments.
