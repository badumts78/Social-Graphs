Add hyper_wiener_index function#TITLE_END#This commit introduces the `hyper_wiener_index`. The function is added to `networkx/algorithms/wiener.py` for consistency with related indices. It is defined for simple, connected, undirected graphs and handles edge weights.  Comprehensive unit tests are included, covering correctness for standard graphs (path, cycle, complete), error handling for unsupported graph types, and behavior with trivial graphs and weighted edges.  Closes #8182

ENH: Add function for Hyper-Wiener Index#TITLE_END#### Proposal  New function, `networkx.hyper_wiener_index(G)`, to calculate the Hyper-Wiener Index of a graph.  The Hyper-Wiener Index ($WW$) is a well-known topological index used in chemical graph theory. It's a natural extension of the existing `nx.wiener_index`. Adding this function would enhance the library's utility for structure-property studies.  ### Proposed Implementation  The index is defined by the formula: $$WW(G) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{u, v \in V(G)} [d(u,v) + d(u,v)^2]$$ where $d(u,v)$ is the shortest path distance between vertices $u$ and $v$.  This can be implemented efficiently by iterating through the results of `nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G)`.  For consistency with `nx.wiener_index`, the function should raise a `NetworkXError` if the input graph is not connected.  I have already started working on this feature and will submit a pull request for review shortly.  ### References * [Wikipedia: Hyper-Wiener Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-Wiener_index) * Randić, M.
