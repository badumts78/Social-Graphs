Implement directed edge swap#TITLE_END#I'm working on a project where I'll be swapping edges to build a baseline distribution of graphs. However, the graphs are directed, so [double_edge_swap](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.swap.double_edge_swap.html) doesn't work. I found an old issue ([#490](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/490)) that mentions a three-edge swapping solution from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.4913.pdf). This PR implements that algorithm, documents it, and adds tests.  A few questions: - I named the new method `directed_edge_swap` to differentiate it from the other two swapping functions. Is that a reasonable name, or should it be `triple_edge_swap`? - Is there a recommended method/citation style for adding references to the documentation?  - The new method avoids creating parallel edges to allow it to work with DiGraph objects, but this leads to situations where it won't perform a swap that would be valid in a MultiDiGraph. I did it that way to be consistent with `double_edge_swap`, but wanted to make sure that that is the intended behavior since neither `double_edge_swap` nor the new `directed_edge_swap` prohibit Multi*[Di]Graph objects.  - When I edit `release_dev.rst`, should this be listed as an improvement or an API change?
