issue
Make a matching generic_edge_bfs to accompany generic_bfs_edge#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> I am addressing issue #5295   @MridulS  I have made a separate function generic_edge_bfs to accompany generic_bfs_edge. Also, I added a function name to doc/reference/algorithms/traversal.rst to connect the new function to the documentation. Can you please take a look at this? Feel free to suggest any more changes to do or something that I have missed or done wrong.   Thanks in advance:)
