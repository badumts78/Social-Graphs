issue
remove_edges_from() affects all copies of a graph, not just the one specified#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  I have built a graph and want to remove edges based on their edge weights. I want to do this repeatedly, for different edge weight thresholds. Therefore, I have copied the original graph (G) by assigning a copy to a new object (G2) to avoid constructing G over and over. When I run remove_edges_from() on G2, the edges are removed as expected. However, I was surprised to see that the same edges are also removed from G.  ### Expected Behavior  My expectation was that G remains unchanged and edges are only removed from G2. Below example creates a graph with 4 nodes and 3 edges. After running `G2.remove_edges_from(ebunch)` I would expect G to still have 4 nodes and 3 edges but both, G and G2 have 4 nodes and 1 edge afterwards.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Using an extended example from the documentation of remove_edges_from()  `G = nx.path_graph(4)` `ebunch = [(1, 2), (2, 3)]` `G2 = G` `G2.remove_edges_from(ebunch)`  ### Environment  Python version: 3.11.2 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  If the described behaviour is intended, how can I create a copy of G and remove edges only from that copy?
