Failed to save graph generated using stochastic_block_model#TITLE_END#Saving a graph that has been generated with a stochastic_block_model is not possible using write_graphml.   ### Current Behavior When generating a random network using the stochastic block model, the returned networkx object cannot be written to a graphml file using the write_graphml function.  ### Expected Behavior When generating random graphs using the networkx package, it should be possible to export them using write_graphml.  ### Steps to Reproduce The following piece of code reproduces the error message:  ``` import networkx as nx  wg = 0.8 # can be any number representing within group probability bg = 0.2 # can be any number representing between group probability community_probs = [[wg, bg, bg],                     [bg, wg, bg],                     [bg, bg, wg]] community_sizes = [10,10,10]  G = nx.stochastic_block_model(community_sizes, community_probs) nx.write_graphml(G, 'file_name.graphml') ```  ### Environment  Python version: 3.9.6 NetworkX version: 2.6.2   ### Additional context Error message:  <img width="795" alt="Screenshot 2021-08-16 at 10 09 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44324476/129532047-658f7207-448b-4e33-8ad2-8092d498c87e.png">
