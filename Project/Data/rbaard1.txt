issue
`subgraph_view` calls filter functions multiple times for each node and edge#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  Consider the following dummy filtering functions to be used with `subgraph_view`: ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.path_graph(3)  def filter_node(n):    print(f'filter_node({n})')    return True  def filter_edge(n1, n2):    print(f'filter_edge({n1}, {n2})')    return True ```  Now, if you call ```python nx.subgraph_view(G, filter_node=filter_node).nodes ``` I would expected the function `filter_node` to be called 3 times: once for each node. But: it is called 6 times.  And if you call ```python nx.subgraph_view(G, filter_edge=filter_edge).edges ``` I would expect the function `filter_edge` to be called 2 times: once for each edge, but it is actually called 12 times.  This pattern seems to hold in general for graphs with `n` nodes: `filter_node` is called `2 * n` times and `filter_edge` is called `6 * n` times.  I am not sure if this should be called a bug, and there might be a good reason for this behavior, but it was certainly unexpected for me. If it is possible to prevent redundant calls to filter functions, this might also speed up the filtering. In the case that this behavior is expected, it might be good to mention it in the documentation for `subgraph_view`.  ### Current Behavior  Calling `nx.subgraph_view(G, filter_node=filter_node).nodes`: ```python filter_node(0) filter_node(1) filter_node(2) filter_node(0) filter_node(1) filter_node(2) ```  Calling `nx.subgraph_view(G, filter_edge=filter_edge).edges`: ```python filter_edge(0, 1) filter_edge(1, 0) filter_edge(1, 2) filter_edge(2, 1) filter_edge(0, 1) filter_edge(0, 1) filter_edge(1, 0) filter_edge(1, 2) filter_edge(1, 0) filter_edge(1, 2) filter_edge(2, 1) filter_edge(2, 1) ```  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior  Calling `nx.subgraph_view(G, filter_node=filter_node).nodes`: ```python filter_node(0) filter_node(1) filter_node(2) ```  Calling `nx.subgraph_view(G, filter_edge=filter_edge).edges`: ```python filter_edge(0, 1) filter_edge(1, 2) ``` or maybe also include the mirrored edges: ```python filter_edge(0, 1) filter_edge(1, 0) filter_edge(1, 2) filter_edge(2, 1) ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10.8 NetworkX version: 3.0
