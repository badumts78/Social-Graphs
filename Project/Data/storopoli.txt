Panther Algorithm for Fast top-k Similarity Search#TITLE_END#Hello,  Could we have an implementation of the Panther Algorithm (Zhang et al., 2015)[^1] ?  According to the authors, the algorithm is very fast to search for similarity when compared to other implementations. SimRank has a complexity of $mathrm{O}\left(I|V|^{2} \bar{d}^{2}\right)$, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices, $\bar{d}$ is the average degree, $I$ is the number of iterations. And Panther has a complexity of $\mathrm{O}\left(|V| \bar{R}T + |V| \bar{M}\right)$, where $\bar{R}$ is the average number of paths that contain a vertex and is proportional to the average degree $\bar{d}$, $T$ is path length, $\bar{M$} represents the average number of co-occurred vertices with a vertex and is proportional to $\bar{d}$.  ![comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fq7Hy5o.png?1) --- [^1]: Zhang, J., Tang, J., Ma, C., Tong, H., Jing, Y., & Li, J.

Guys, since I was the one who brought the panther paper as a feature request, I will chip in and give my two cents.  Since the algorithm and code returns a dictionary of nodes, I prefer `panther_similarity` without any `paths`. We are not returning paths I guess only similar nodes.  Also `panther_similarity_plus_plus` is a little big. What about `panther_similarity_pp`?

Any news guys? Will it be released in the next version?

@mrecachinas great job! Waiting for the panther++ algorithm also...

@dschult according to the original Panther article, $R$ is the number of random paths and $\phi$  is the probability that an element sampled from a set A $\subseteq$ D, where D is the domain.  ref: Zhang, J., Tang, J., Ma, C., Tong, H., Jing, Y., & Li, J.
