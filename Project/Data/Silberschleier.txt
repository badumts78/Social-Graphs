I would also be willing to contribute some code, which approximates the ged with simulated annealing, similar to the approach of Kostakis and Kinable in https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1982509 My current implementation would need some clean up and abstraction for more general problems though. So would this algorithm be something you are interested in?

Sorry for the late answer, but I'm currently occupied with other projects. This is also why it might take me some time to port my implementation.  @ramaroberto Sure. It is not published though yet, so just contact me by mail (address should be visible in my profile) and I'll send it to you.
