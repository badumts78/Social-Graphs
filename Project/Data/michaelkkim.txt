networkx harmonic centrality vs. closeness centrality#TITLE_END#I'm currently running networkx 1.11  **Issue:** When I run networkx.harmonic_centrality(G), there is a huge memory leakage (ran on ~60,000 nodes). I checked the documentation page, and it's only listed under 'latest' version but not under 'stable' or 'networkx-1.11' versions. Even though I checked that this function does exist in networkx 1.11, is it an unstable function currently?   If so, how can I tweak parameters/source codes to run harmonic centrality on all my nodes as described in 'latest' version.               **i.e.** Would using non-normalized networkx.closeness_centrality(G) be the same as              network.harmonic_centrality(G)?               **i.e.** Would dividing all my closeness_centrality values by n-1 be the same as networkx.harmonic_centrality(G)?  Thank you.

Graph.to_undirected()#TITLE_END#Hello,  I'm currently working on a big citation network data ('older' nodes cannot cite 'newer' nodes, whereas 'newer' nodes can cite 'older' nodes).  When I convert my graph to an undirected version using 'Graph.to_undirected()', the number of nodes stay the same, but the number of edges decreases for some reason. Why is this so?  The only reason I can think of is that if two nodes 'cite' each other (have two directed edges pointing to each other), 'Graph.to_undirected()' forms this as one edge. However, this should not be possible in a citation network data... (assuming my edgelist data is correct)
