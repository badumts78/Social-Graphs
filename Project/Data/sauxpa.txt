add paley graph#TITLE_END#Hi,  I'm a young researcher in math with a keen interest in graphs. I've been using networkx a lot recently so I'd like to start contributing.  I've been doing some work around expanders, a class of regular graphs for which there are only two generators currently available in networkx. This is a proposal to add the class of Paley graphs, a family of graphs on p nodes obtained by matching x and y iif y-x is a square mod p.   Said graphs are indeed regular when p is a prime number (there are (p-1)/2 distinct squares in this case).  I tried to match the style of existing functions in expanders.py and the associated test, but any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  Patrick  P.S : below is a visualization of Paley graphs for a few increasing values of p: ![paley](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46052865/78700059-26255680-7905-11ea-9269-d27197ca6fc0.gif)
