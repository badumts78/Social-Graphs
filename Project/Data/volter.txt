[Patch] Dot files with grouped edges are not treated properly#TITLE_END#Edge notations like the below cause a crash, as the returned object is not a string, but a frozen dictionary. Thus it has no strip method. Source and destination should be iterated for both, source and destination.  a -- { b c } { a b } -- c { a b } -- { c d }  import networkx as nx G = nx.read_dot( 'my_file.dot' )  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "./toponet_conf-hosts.py", line 56, in <module>     G=nx.read_dot('my_map.dot')   File "<string>", line 2, in read_dot   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 263, in _open_file     result = func(_new_args, *_kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py", line 69, in read_dot     return from_pydot(P)   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py", line 122, in from_pydot     v=e.get_destination().strip('"') AttributeError: 'frozendict' object has no attribute 'strip'  http://www.geofrogger.net/review/0001-Dot-files-with-grouped-edges-are-not-treated-properl.patch  Ugly little hackish patch that works fine for me
