Enhancements change default join trees 6947#TITLE_END#<!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code. For more details check out step 1 and 4 of https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html --> This PR addresses GitHub Issue #6947, improving the default behavior of `join_trees`. Now, node attributes won't store old labels unless specified with `label_attribute`. It also introduces a `first_label` argument for specifying the root node's label. Tests for no `label_attribute` and custom `first_label` are included, enhancing flexibility while minimizing attribute creation. Additionally, it fixes a regression where the code depended on old labels.
