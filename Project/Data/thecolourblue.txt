issue
graphml - compatibility with graph-tool#TITLE_END#Hi,  I would like to be able to read/write graphml files produced by graph-tool without loss. I ran into an issue with a 'vector_float' property from graph-tool which should map to a list [] property in networkx. Networkx chokes when it encounters the 'vector_float' attr.type which is not a standard type.  The attribute type that graph-tool uses for a 2d vector is 'vector_float'. The header of a sample graph-tool xml files looks like this:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns"      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"      xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd">  <!-- property keys --> <key id="key0" for="node" attr.name="centrality" attr.type="int" /> <key id="key1" for="node" attr.name="pos" attr.type="vector_float" /> ```  and a typical node data looks like this:  ``` <node id="n1">   <data key="key0">6</data>   <data key="key1">0x1.5c71d0cb8d943p+3, 0x1.70db7f4083655p+3</data> </node> ```  ... and no, I don't know how the floats are encoded.  So it seems graph-tool has simply added a few extra types which it can read and write- there is no schema for them.  ``` //src/boost-workaround/boost/graph/graphml.hpp:243 template<typename MutableGraph> const char* mutate_graph_impl<MutableGraph>::m_type_names[] = {"boolean", "short", "int", "long", "float", "double", "vector_boolean", "vector_int",  "vector_long", "vector_float", "vector_double", "vector_string", "string",  "python_object"}; ```  So probably graph-tools xml is not valid- but its not going to be a simple change for them to fix it.   Would it be easier for networkx to made some modifications to allow reading graph-tools' graphml?
