issue
Weighted subgraph isomorphism#TITLE_END#Hi group,  I have two questions with relation to this title: 1. I have AdjGraph class as following:  class AdjGraph(nx.Graph):  def **init**(self):  super(AdjGraph,self).**init**()  self.ax=None  self._nodesize=30  self._pos={}  and I have object adj1, adj2 of class AdjGraph,  then I want to use  import networkx.algorithms.isomorphism as iso em=*** GM=iso.GraphMatcher(adj1,adj2,edge_match=em) print GM  GM is None, which suggests that GraphMatcher not initialized. I check user manual which says input parameters should be object of nx.Graph().  so how can I set my adj object as input to get GM properly?  2.Does networkx 1.7 support weighted subgraph monomorphism, and how to use it?  (I post this topoic on google group either but i can't find it. I apologize if this duplication bothers you much, actually i am not familiar with goole group workflow)
