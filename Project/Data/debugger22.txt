@MridulS  For `x.y.z`  `x` is increased in case of compatibility breaks. `y` is increased in case of additional features. `z` is increased in case of bug fixes.  `1.10` seems apt as suggested by @ysitu.

There are no rules, though. Linux kernel `4.0` was released after `3.19` even though there were no compatibility breaks.

This is not mathematical equality. `1.1 != 1.10` :)

I think you can have only one PR from one branch. Why not use `git cherry-pick`?

Perhaps this change was not tested. Imports from `__future__` should be at the top(first python command). Failing to do so results in a syntax error.

@chebee7i  I wonder if doc generation is covered on travis-ci.
