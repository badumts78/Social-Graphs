minimum_st_node_cut returns empty dict instead of empty set#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  If you use the method "minimum_st_node_cut" from connectivity with nodes s and t which are directly connected by an edge, the method returns an empty dictionary instead of an empty set.  This is due to the following code part: ```     if G.has_edge(s, t) or G.has_edge(t, s):         return {} ```  ### Expected Behavior  The method minimum_st_node_cut declares to return a set of nodes.  So I would expect to get a set in this case, too, not a dict.  ```     Returns     -------     cutset : set         Set of nodes that, if removed, would destroy all paths between         source and target in G. ```  Probably just a typo: To create an empty set, you would have to use set(), not {} . So the fix should be:  ```     if G.has_edge(s, t) or G.has_edge(t, s):         return set() ```  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from(["s", "t"]) G.add_edges_from([("s", "t")]) separator = nx.algorithms.connectivity.minimum_st_node_cut(G, "s", "t") print (type(separator)) ```  ### Environment  Python version: 3.13.1 NetworkX version: 3.4.2  ### Additional context  It may be unexpected to some users to get an empty nodeset if s and t are directly connected by an edge, even if it is described e.g. in Diestel "Graph Theory", 6. ed., Springer 2025, on page 11 that a nodesset is a separator for vertices a and b if it separates those two vertices and doesn't include a and b. So maybe a hint in the documentation that you should check for an edge between s and t before calling this method would be helpful. Or the documentation for this method could include the information that two totally unconnected nodes s and t and two directly connected nodes s and t with an edge "st" or "ts" will both result in an empty set as return value.
