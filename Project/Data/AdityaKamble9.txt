Fix SSH Authentication Issue for Community Detection Example Code Using Girvan-Newman#TITLE_END#This repository provides an implementation of community detection using the Girvan-Newman algorithm, specifically applied to the Zachary Karate Club dataset. The project aims to demonstrate how to identify communities within a network by analyzing the modularity of graph structures. The provided example code showcases the process of edge removal to reveal underlying community structures, along with visualizations that highlight the detected communities. Additionally, the repository includes instructions for setting up the environment, running the code, and resolving common issues, such as SSH authentication errors. This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding community detection algorithms and their practical applications in network analysis.
