Updated docstring for generators/karate_club_graph()#TITLE_END#Added the following lines to the `karate_club_graph()` docstring in `networkx/generators/social.py`:  ```     The dataset is derived from the 'Club After Split From Data' column of Table 3 in the source paper.     This was in turn derived from the 'Club After Fission' column of Table 1 in the same paper.     Note that the nodes are 0-indexed in NetworkX, but 1-indexed in the paper     (the 'Individual Number in Matrix C' column of Table 3 starts at 1).     This means, for example, that G.nodes[9]["club"] returns 'Officer',     which corresponds to row 10 of Table 3 in the paper. ```  Closes #7519 #7515

Hi @Schefflera-Arboricola, I'd be happy to take this if it's still open.  From reading the discussions and the original paper, it seems that something like the below needs to be added to `karate_club_graph()` in `networkx/generators/social.py`:  ``` The dataset is derived from the 'Club After Split From Data' column of Table 3 in the source paper (see below).  The Table 3 column was in turn derived from the 'Club After Fission' column of Table 1 in the same paper.  Note that the nodes are 0-indexed in NetworkX, but 1-indexed in the paper (the 'Individual Number in Matrix C' column of Table 3 starts at 1). This means, for example, that G.nodes[9]["club"] returns 'Officer', which corresponds to row 10 of Table 3 in the paper. ```  I'll make the change if you feel this covers it.
