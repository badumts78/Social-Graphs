issue
Use dict instead of OrderedDict since dict is ordered by default from Python 3.6#TITLE_END#Fixes #4143 
issue
Replace OrderedDict with dict in simple_paths module#TITLE_END#From Python 3.6 dicts are ordered by default and 3.6 is the minimum version for the project. In `all_simple_paths` function OrderedDict is used which can be replaced with dict. Since `popitem` and `__setitem__` are heavily used where `OrderedDict` performs some more [additional work](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e28b8c93878072dc02b116108ef5443084290d47/Lib/collections/__init__.py#L174) that is not needed here. Some perf benchmarks for a large graph.
