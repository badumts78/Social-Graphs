issue
two nodal role functions, louvain#TITLE_END#I built two different versions of nodal role measures (participation coefficient, and within-module-degree). The nodal_roles_nx.py works with the published Louvain that has been discussed. The nodal_roles_brainx.py works with the brainx classes of weighted_modularity (again, Louvain). The brainx version is faster. Depending on how y'all decide to output the modularity partition results, either one will work, and I can write some tests then and improve the speed a bit.

Is there anyway to get some bayesian graph manipulation tools like moralizing and triangulating?#TITLE_END#I have been wrapping old matlab code, but networkx stuff would be great!
