[: Feature Request] - Syntax sugar for filtering/quering of nodes and edges#TITLE_END#Influenced from python-igraph: ---  python-igraph has a pretty cool sytax sugar like ref: https://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html#querying-vertices-and-edges-based-on-attributes - find - select - slicing virtices and edges, etc  Examples: ```python  # Find vertex by attributes claire = g.vs.find(name="Claire")  # Looking up vertices by names assert g.degree("Dennis") == g.vs.find("Dennis").degree()  # Select vertices as per filter function g.vs.select(lambda vertex: vertex.index % 2 == 1)   # Select vertices from the input list g.vs.select(2, 4, 6)   # Select vertices as per attribute condtion g.vs.select(age_lt=30)  g.vs(age_in=[10, 20, 30])  # Select Edge b/w men and women men = g.vs.select(gender="m") women = g.vs.select(gender="f") g.es.select(_between=(men, women))  # Slicing vertices and edges g.vs[4:40] g.es[3:-2] ```  ## I am fascinated by this following feature table:  Keyword argument | Meaning -- | -- name_eq | The attribute/property value must be equal to the value of the keyword argument name_ne | The attribute/property value must not be equal to the value of the keyword argument name_lt | The attribute/property value must be less than the value of the keyword argument name_le | The attribute/property value must be less than or equal to the value of the keyword argument name_gt | The attribute/property value must be greater than the value of the keyword argument name_ge | The attribute/property value must be greater than or equal to the value of the keyword argument name_in | The attribute/property value must be included in the value of the keyword argument, which must be a sequence in this case name_notin | The attribute/property value must not be included in the value of the the keyword argument, which must be a sequence in this case   ## Feature Request: - Even though we can do all the above with few lines of python code the examples shown above is pretty neat and handy. - Let me know what you folks think.   Thanks  *PS: I think networkx is pretty neat and easy to start with.*
