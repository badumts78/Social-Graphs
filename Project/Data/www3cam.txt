issue
nx.navigable_small_world generates a list of edges with 3 dimensions#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> Maybe there is a reason for this, but I expect navigable_small_worlds `__init__` to generate a list of edges with size and dimension (-1,2).  However with this specification: `G = nx.navigable_small_world_graph(10, p=4, q=2, r=1.5, dim=2, seed=None)` it generates a edge matrix with dimension (-1,2,2).  It looks like it is pairing tuples with other tuples as many tuples repeat in this matrix.     ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> See above   ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> See above   ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9.7 NetworkX version:  2.7.1   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
