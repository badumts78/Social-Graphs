Min cost flow non-termination with negative cost cycle of finite capacity#TITLE_END#The current min cost flow implementation does not terminate on a simple problem involving a negative cycle with finite capacity:  ``` import networkx G = networkx.DiGraph() G.add_edge('a', 'b', capacity=1, weight=-1) G.add_edge('b', 'a', capacity=1, weight=-1) print networkx.min_cost_flow_cost(G) ```  Am I misinterpreting the guarantees stated in the code documentation?  (The documentation seems only to disallow negative cycles of infinite capacity, but seems to imply that negative cost cycles of finite capacity should be ok?)
