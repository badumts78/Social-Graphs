ENH: allow greedy_color strategies to be specified as strings#TITLE_END#I like the new `greedy_color()` algorithm, but passing strategy functions directly is inconvenient. This PR adds the ability to specify strategies as strings, and is entirely backward-compatible.  Here is an example:  ``` python # Old syntax still works: >>> colors1 = nx.coloring.greedy_color(G, strategy=nx.coloring.strategy_connected_sequential)  # New syntax works as follows >>> colors2 = nx.coloring.greedy_color(G, strategy='connected_sequential')  >>> colors1 == colors2 True ```  This also helps improve the inline documentation:  Old documentation:  ``` python >>> help(nx.coloring.greedy_color) ... greedy_color(G, strategy=<function networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_coloring.strategy_largest_first>, interchange=False) ... ```  New documentation:  ``` python >>> help(nx.coloring.greedy_color) ... greedy_color(G, strategy='largest_first', interchange=False) ... ```  I think the new help output, with the default strategy as a string rather than the function, is much more user-friendly.

Regarding csgraph: there is no divergence that I'm aware of.  I initially developed a couple algorithms for scikit-learn.  After some discussion on the mailing list (including feedback from some NetworkX folks) I put together a bigger compendium of common cythonized graph routines and added them to scipy.  At the time, the NetworkX folks we talked to said that they were not interested in having any cythonized routines within the package, otherwise we may have gone another direction with the functionality.  Scikit-learn maintains a back-port of some of these (without any additional functionality) because it wants to maintain conservative dependency requirements.  Any new work happening on the csgraph algorithms is happening in scipy, and I'm still involved as a package maintainer (though I'm not actively adding new functionality ATM).

Another option would be to depend on scipy, and contribute to what's already in there.  But that leaves you with much less flexibility.

>  they kind of decided to stop scikits.  Nobody ever decided to "stop scikits".  The thread you linked to was part of the discussion of _starting_ the scikits idea, not stopping it! I think when the idea was hatched, there was hope that it would take off a bit more than it did: currently only scikit-learn, scikit-image, and statsmodels seem to have gained significant momentum, though there are some others lurking out there.  One of the early problems was that Python's import architecture back in 2.5-2.6 caused issues with having a `scikits` namespace that multiple packages install into... I think that had something to do with the lack of uptake, and it's why we now have, e.g. `sklearn` and `skimage` rather than the original `scikits.learn` and `scikits.image`.  Nevertheless, the concept is sound: SciPy cannot contain all functionality under the sun, so there should be a well-established ecosystem of tools built around it.

They have always been separate projects: that was the idea from the beginning.  The concern was that scipy was growing too big, and was getting to the point where many of the components were superfluous to the average user. There was discussion of splitting up scipy and having multiple separate packages install into the `scipy` namespace. In the discussion it became clear that that would be too confusing. The compromise was the introduction of the `scikits` namespace, which would allow more specialized functionality to be developed in a separate repository. Anyone could develop a scikit, and none of them are explicitly linked to scipy. From the beginning they've been separate projects.

I still think a uniform interface across all packages would be more useful than a non-uniform paragraph somewhere on each package's web page. It would not be obscure if everyone were used to using it.  But yes, I agree that no momentum has built behind the idea. When the perfect is the enemy of the good, the status quo will always reign.

I tried advocating, but everywhere it's been discussed the discussion has become a flurry of competing suggestions, with everyone finding fault with everyone else's ideas. After a while, the discussion peters out and nothing happens. So I'm not sure if this idea or something like it will be adopted more widely...
