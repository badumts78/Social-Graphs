issue
Bug when checking flow feasibility in networksimplex.py#TITLE_END#In line 543-544 of network simplex.py the following code is ran:     if any(x[i] != 0 for i in range(-n, 0)):         raise nx.NetworkXUnfeasible('no flow satisfies all node demands') I ran a debugger on my algorithm in PyCharm and noticed when I got to this point, some of my elements of x were 4.4 x 10^(-16). Clearly this number is 0, but the code does not recognize it as 0 and therefore returns and error to me when inputted with a graph where a flow is possible. I changed line 543 to read:     if any(round(x[i], 10) != 0 for i in range(-n, 0)): Once I made this change my code passed and no longer had any errors. I recommend y'all implement some kind of change like this so that elements of x that are essentially 0 recognized as such.  How will I know if/when this change is made?  Best!
