Error in nx.simple_cycles algorithm for directed graphs#TITLE_END#I would like to report what I believe to be a bug in the function   nx.simple_cycles(g)  In one case where the graph has 6 nodes I find a cycle with 7 nodes because node number 1 appears twice. Here is a description of the directed graph  nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  edges = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]  It has 25 cycles [[5, 3, 4], [5, 3, 2, 4], [5, 2, 4], [5, 1, 3, 4], [5, 1, 3, 2, 4], [5, 1, 0, 3, 4], [5, 1, 0, 3, 2, 4], [5, 1, 0, 2, 4], [5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 4], [5, 0, 3, 4], [5, 0, 3, 2, 4], [5, 0, 2, 4], [5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 4], [4, 1, 3], [4, 1, 3, 2], [4, 1, 0, 3], [4, 1, 0, 3, 2], [4, 1, 0, 2], [4, 0, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2], [4, 0, 2], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2]]  And cycle number 8 is too long it is  [5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 4]  which cannot be allowed since a cycle cannot visit the same node more than once.  I did try the function recursive_simple_cycles which seems to work  A python example file is below. #   import networkx as nx  g=nx.DiGraph()  g.add_edge(0,2) g.add_edge(0,3) g.add_edge(1,0) g.add_edge(1,3) g.add_edge(2,1) g.add_edge(2,4) g.add_edge(3,2) g.add_edge(3,4) g.add_edge(4,0) g.add_edge(4,1) g.add_edge(4,5) g.add_edge(5,0) g.add_edge(5,1) g.add_edge(5,2) g.add_edge(5,3) nx.draw_circular(g)  cycles = list(nx.simple_cycles(g)) numLoops = len(cycles)  print sorted(g.nodes()) print sorted(g.edges()) print "Num Cycles " + str(numLoops) print "Cycle number " + str(8) print "Long cycle " + str(cycles[8]) print "All cycles " + str(cycles)
