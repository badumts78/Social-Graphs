bipartite graph with similarity clustering of the two subgraphs#TITLE_END#I would like to implement a weighted bipartite graph with similarity clustering of the two subgraphs. A good example is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605000/figure/F1/). Each subgraph will be clustered according to a similarity matrix. Edges between the two subgraphs will be weighted.  So far we can implement a  spring_layout for a graph using Fruchterman Reingold based on a distance matrix. Also, It is possible do a weighted bipartite graph. I am looking for a way to combine the two approaches in the same layout.   ​Thanks​
