issue
relabel_nodes adds a graph attribute when copy=True#TITLE_END#I would have expected the following to work:  ``` import networkx as nx graph_a = nx.DiGraph() graph_b = nx.relabel_nodes(graph_a, {}, copy=True) print "graph_a.graph", graph_a.graph print "graph_b.graph", graph_b.graph assert graph_a.graph == graph_b.graph ```  However, it does not since [_relabel_copy attempts to copy a non-existent graph attribute, 'name'](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/1675a824d6cdb17c3144ef46ff52a0c2b53a11d1/networkx/relabel.py#L150).  I would have expected relabel_nodes to only change the node labels, while maintaining all graph/node/edge attributes.
