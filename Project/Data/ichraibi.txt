issue
Networkx and Matplotlib do not allow to plot self-loop#TITLE_END# <!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> Hi all,  I have been trying to draw a networkx multidigraph with multiple self-loops on nodes using matplotlib for quite a few days now but nothing works. After multiple tests, I narrowed the problem to Networkx with Matplotlib. I executed the following tutorial https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/drawing/plot_selfloops.html on my laptop and using an online python compiler but no self-loop get printed. I think there might be a bug somewhere since it is supposed to work according the official documentation.  Please do not propose to used Graphviz... I know it works with it, but that does not interest me.  I would like to exploit my graph edges features to display them according to a heat map. It works perfectly with edges between different nodes but not on the self-loop edges on the same node.  ### Current Behavior From the tutorial, here is the image that I obtain :  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1157738/116091673-5a50ee00-a6a5-11eb-9723-eb3cc5e2382b.png)  ### Expected Behavior The image that I'm supposed to obtain : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1157738/116091703-63da5600-a6a5-11eb-92c7-d5c8209b193d.png)  ### Steps to Reproduce Here is the code from the tutorial :  import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  ##### Create a graph and add a self-loop to node 0 G = nx.complete_graph(3, create_using=nx.DiGraph) G.add_edge(0, 0) pos = nx.circular_layout(G)  ##### As of version 2.6, self-loops are drawn by default with the same styling as ##### other edges nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True)  ##### Add self-loops to the remaining nodes edgelist = [(1, 1), (2, 2)] G.add_edges_from(edgelist)  ##### Draw the newly added self-loops with different formatting nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=edgelist, arrowstyle="<|-", style="dashed")  plt.show()  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3 NetworkX version: 2.5 (I upraded it)   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
