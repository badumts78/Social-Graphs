issue
networkx.drawing.nx_pydot.read_dot parses dot files incorrectly#TITLE_END#I tried to load the dot file of a control flow graph created by LLVM down below into a networkx graph using this code: ```python import networkx.drawing.nx_pydot as nxp import networkx as nx g = nx.read_dot("/path/to/file/cfg.dot") print(g.nodes) ``` When looking at the dotfile down below one would assume three nodes being connected by two edges. But in reality one more node gets created with the label "\\\\n".     ### Steps to Reproduce  Load following dotfile with the code above and print the node list: ```dot digraph "CFG for 'fn_1140' function" { 	label="CFG for 'fn_1140' function";  	Node0x5563aaa6daa0 [shape=record,color="#b70d28ff", style=filled, fillcolor="#b70d2870",label="{entry_fn_1140}"]; 	Node0x5563aaa6daa0 -> Node0x5563aaa6f850; 	Node0x5563aaa6dc60 [shape=record,color="#b70d28ff", style=filled, fillcolor="#b70d2870",label="{exit_fn_1140}"]; 	Node0x5563aaa6f850 [shape=record,color="#b70d28ff", style=filled, fillcolor="#b70d2870",label="{bb_1140}"]; 	Node0x5563aaa6f850 -> Node0x5563aaa6dc60; } ```  When removing the newline immediately preceeding the closing curly brace, we get the correct graph. Also when swapping the last node definition with the last edge definition.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 2.6.3 Pydot version: 1.4.2
