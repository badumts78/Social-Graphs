issue
node-mapping bug expected_degree_graph#TITLE_END#Hi I used the NX1 expected_degree_graph generator. It has the same interface as the NX2.  https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.degree_seq.expected_degree_graph.html#networkx.generators.degree_seq.expected_degree_graph  But NX2 will not generate the graph correctly. The total number of edge is always 1. No further error message provided.  Same script works well for NX1. (I downgrade to older version.  ```python D = 10 N = 1000 degree_l = [D for i in range(N)] G = nx.expected_degree_graph(degree_l, seed=datetime.now(), selfloops=False) ```
