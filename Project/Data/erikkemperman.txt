Error in documentation of katz_centrality? #TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  The docs for katz centrality state: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/f20ba5f2f6462af8f1ac9b1772ffa5b4bcca4d58/networkx/algorithms/centrality/katz.py#L131-L132  The value for `beta` here was changed from 1 to 0 a long time ago, in this commit: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/b33ebd46a32558b1f33bd3caa6030e21502e17bf#diff-fd4d6088095ce7547e9e07adf7326d408cb55f6ef43d47aeba7f53d405b44b8dL259  Which I think may have been an incorrect response to issue https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1247.  ### Expected Behavior  I believe that the previous note with `beta=1` was actually correct. For what it's worth, here are the relevant parts of the implementation in current master:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/6971d845e25aa4b76879831bb85ac2fa23ae0c9e/networkx/algorithms/centrality/katz.py#L153-L166  If we assume that `nstart` is left to the default of `None`, we see that `x` starts out being all zeroes. But then, unless `beta` is non-zero for at least some of the nodes, it is impossible for any element of `x` to ever become non-zero:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/6971d845e25aa4b76879831bb85ac2fa23ae0c9e/networkx/algorithms/centrality/katz.py#L168-L177  In other words, it looks to me like if `nstart=None` and `beta=0` then Katz centrality will always produce an array of zeroes. And in particular, even if `alpha` is (ever so slightly less than) `1/lambda_max` it will *not* resemble the eigenvector centrality.  ### Steps to Reproduce  (EDITED) Figured I should add an example, adapted from the example in the docs:  ```python3 import math G = nx.path_graph(4) phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2.0  # largest eigenvalue of adj matrix  print(f"For reference: eigenvector centrality") eig_centrality = nx.eigenvector_centrality(G) for n, c in sorted(eig_centrality.items()):     print(f"{n} {c:.2f}") # 0 0.37 # 1 0.60 # 2 0.60 # 3 0.37  print(f"Katz with beta=1.0") katz_centrality_0 = nx.katz_centrality(G, alpha=(1 / phi - 0.01), beta=1.0) for n, c in sorted(katz_centrality_0.items()):     print(f"{n} {c:.2f}") # 0 0.37 # 1 0.60 # 2 0.60 # 3 0.37  print(f"Katz with beta=0.0") katz_centrality_1 = nx.katz_centrality(G, (1 / phi - 0.01), beta=0.0) for n, c in sorted(katz_centrality_1.items()):     print(f"{n} {c:.2f}") # 0 0.00 # 1 0.00 # 2 0.00 # 3 0.00 ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version: 3.0rc
