Optimize _single_shortest_path_length#TITLE_END#The helper function  _networkx.algorithms.shortest_path.unweighted.**_single_shortest_path_length**_  can be optimized.  **Current implementation**: add neighbours of visited nodes to "nextlevel" set. Later, iterate through "nextlevel" set to expand their unseen neighbours. Iterate until "nextlevel" is empty.  **Suggested optimization 1**: keep track of nodes to be expanded in a queue (collections.deque) that remains sorted by distance from source node. Do not add already visited nodes to any set.  **Suggested optimization 2**: terminate immediately if all nodes have been visited. This saves a lot of work for dense, strongly connected graphs.  Investigation and analysis shows the effectiveness of the optimizations. Measured speedup is **at least a factor of 2**, for graphs where python overhead is not dominating. For dense strongly connected graphs, the speedup factor can be up to O(n), where n is the number of nodes.  Below are some speed tests with random graphs (the first 5 graphs), and some special structure graphs.  ``` time / ms                    current         optimized            n=1e1, m=1e1                    0.15              0.14              n=1e1, m=3e1                    0.34              0.18             n=1e2, m=1e2                    2.04              1.35            n=1e3, m=1e3                   56.76             31.89          n=1e3, m=1e5                27857.46            612.96         caveman(100,10)              3373.64           1168.82        windmill(10, 10)               32.08              4.09           nary_tree(3, 1000)           1886.88            810.51        complete(100)                 205.25              3.48           ```  I have published a more thorough post on my blog [garageofcode: optimizing shortest path length](https://garageofcode.blogspot.com/2019/10/optimizing-shortestpathlength-in.html). This includes an analysis of why we observe this speedup.   Since this is my first pull request here, I would like to say thank you for a great package!  Also, please make comments about style and content of this pull request, including this description itself.   //Jonatan
