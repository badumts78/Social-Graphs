SpanningTreeIterator fails for MultiGraphs#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> From my layman understanding it seems as if the SpanningTreeIterator was written with MultiGraphs in mind. However, trying it with a MultiGraph yields repeated output of the same spanning tree.  ### Current Behavior Using the SpanningTreeIterator with a MultiGraph outputs many times the same spanning tree and not all possible spanning trees.  Consider the three cycle graph given by edges [(0,1),(1,2),(0,2)]. Then currently for this viewed as a multigraph it gives four times the spanning tree [(0,1), (0,2)]. <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior Get all different spanning trees on the graph.  For the above example it should give the following 3 spanning trees: [(0,1),(0,2)], [(0,2),(1,2)], [(0,1),(1,2)]. <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` for g in nx.SpanningTreeIterator(nx.cycle_graph(3,create_using=nx.MultiGraph)):     print(g.edges()) ``` gives the wrong result whereas ``` for g in nx.SpanningTreeIterator(nx.cycle_graph(3,create_using=nx.Graph)):     print(g.edges()) ``` gives the expected result.  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.12.3 NetworkX version: 3.3
