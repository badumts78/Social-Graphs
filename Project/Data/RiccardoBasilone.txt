keys added as edge attributes when using nx.from_pandas_edgelist#TITLE_END#Hi there, regarding the nx.from_pandas_edgelist function, when creating multigraphs:  ### Current Behavior  Following the example in the documentation, but calling "edge_attr = True" instead of "edge_attr=["weight", "color"]", the edge keys get added to the graph not only as keys, but also as edge attributes. i.e G.edges(data=True) outputs: `MultiEdgeDataView([(0, 2, {'my_edge_key': 'A', 'weight': 3, 'color': 'red'}), (0, 2, {'my_edge_key': 'D', 'weight': 6, 'color': 'blue'}), (2, 1, {'my_edge_key': 'B', 'weight': 4, 'color': 'blue'}), (2, 3, {'my_edge_key': 'C', 'weight': 5, 'color': 'blue'})])` I do not think this is intended behavior, as edge keys are not edge attributes.  In other words If we start with a multigraph and save it to a pandas edgelist using `nx.to_pandas_edgelist()`, the graph we load from that same edgelist in this way has an extra attribute (my_edge_key).  ### Expected Behavior keys should only be added as keys, as is what happens when you manually specify which columns are edge_attr.  ### Steps to Reproduce  `edges = pd.DataFrame(     {         "source": [0, 1, 2, 0],         "target": [2, 2, 3, 2],         "my_edge_key": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],         "weight": [3, 4, 5, 6],         "color": ["red", "blue", "blue", "blue"],     } )`  ` G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(     edges,     edge_key="my_edge_key",     edge_attr=["weight", "color"],     create_using=nx.MultiGraph(), ) `  ### Environment  NetworkX version: 3.2.1
