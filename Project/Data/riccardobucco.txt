issue
Exception not raised when `to_graph6_bytes` is used on directed graphs#TITLE_END#When I use `networkx.readwrite.graph6.to_graph6_bytes` with a **directed** graph, I expect a `NetworkXNotImplemented` exception to be raised (because the graph6 format is for undirected graphs only). This is also stated in the method docstring: ``` Raises ------ NetworkXNotImplemented     If the graph is directed or is a multigraph. ```   ### Current Behavior ``` >>> import networkx as nx >>> nx.to_graph6_bytes(nx.DiGraph()) b'>>graph6<<?\n' ```  ### Expected Behavior ``` >>> import networkx as nx >>> nx.to_graph6_bytes(nx.DiGraph()) ... networkx.exception.NetworkXNotImplemented: not implemented for directed type ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.10.4 NetworkX version: 2.7.2rc1.dev0   ### Additional context Here you can find the description of the graph6 format: [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt](url)

Don't use graph6 with directed graphs (#5443)#TITLE_END#I also added a few tests for the `to_graph6_bytes` method (they're very similar to those for the `write_graph6` method).  Closes #5443
