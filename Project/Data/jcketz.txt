NetworkXError: Graph is not connected. average_shortest_path_length#TITLE_END#I beg your pardon, but I'm asking myself why there is this error limitation. Is it impossible to ask for the average shortest path in an unconnected graph?  Here is my solution to solve this issue, hope it gonna help and give idea to make this function evolve! Thanks for this wonderful library!  def average_shortest_path_length_for_all(G):</br></br>     tempgraph=G.copy();     if nx.is_connected(tempgraph):         # Normal case, the graph is connected          average=nx.average_shortest_path_length(tempgraph);     else:         # Try to see if the graph is not connected because of isolated nodes         tempgraph.remove_nodes_from(nx.isolates(tempgraph));         if nx.is_connected(tempgraph):             # Compute the graph average path without isolated nodes              average=nx.average_shortest_path_length(tempgraph);         else:             # Compute the average shortest path for each subgraph and mean it!             subgraphs = nx.connected_component_subgraphs(tempgraph)             average=0;             for sb in subgraphs:                 pprint.pprint(sb.degree());                 average+=nx.average_shortest_path_length(sb);             average/=(len(subgraphs)*1.0)     return average;
