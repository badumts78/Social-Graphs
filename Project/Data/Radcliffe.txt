Sudoku graph generator#TITLE_END#I propose adding a graph generator for Sudoku graphs.  The Sudoku graph has 81 vertices, corresponding to the cells of an empty Sudoku grid. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding cells belong to the same row, column, or 3x3 box. Solving a Sudoku puzzle is equivalent to finding a vertex coloring with nine colors, extending a partial coloring given by the clues.  A Sudoku graph generator would be useful for people who are interested in developing algorithms to solve or generate Sudoku puzzles. The Sudoku graph is also an object of interest for researchers in graph theory and related fields.  I have written code to generate Sudoku graphs and I will submit a pull request. Thank you for your consideration.

 One approach is to choose points along a spiral, as described in equation (8) of this article: http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/saffeb/texts/161.pdf  Here is a quick-and-dirty implementation of the algorithm. ```python # Arrange N points on the surface of a sphere along a spiral. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D  %matplotlib notebook  def points_on_sphere(n):     h = -1 + 2 * np.arange(0, n) / (n - 1)     theta = np.arccos(h)     phi = np.zeros(n)     phi[1:-1] = np.cumsum(3.6/np.sqrt(n) * (1 - h[1:-1]**2)**(-0.5)) % (2 * np.pi)     return theta, phi   def spherical_to_cartesian(theta, phi, r=1):     s = r * np.sin(phi)     x = s * np.cos(theta)     y = s * np.sin(theta)     z = r * np.cos(phi)     return x, y, z   def plot_points(n):     fig = plt.figure()     ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')     theta, phi = points_on_sphere(n)     x, y, z = spherical_to_cartesian(theta, phi)     ax.scatter(x, y, z, marker='o')     plt.show()   plot_points(200) ``` ![Screenshot_2020-01-08 Distributing points evenly on a sphere - Jupyter Notebook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/676260/72021075-c9959b00-3232-11ea-89a8-1dfc2ddfeda4.png)
