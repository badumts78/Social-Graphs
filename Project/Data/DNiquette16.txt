issue
Developing function to calculate path cost for any user-specified path#TITLE_END#Hello!   So I wrote a function called "path_weight" to calculate the cost of a specific path with respect to a specified edge attribute (e.g. cost, weight, distance). I believe I have a function that works properly with graphs as well as multigraphs and throws an error if the path does not exist. However, this is my first time submitting work to a project like this so I would love any feedback as I am sure this is far from being ready to merge.   Also, this is connected to issue #3357  Thanks!
