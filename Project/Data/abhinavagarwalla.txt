issue
read_graphml fails to open graph generated by write_graphml#TITLE_END#I get the following error when reading a graph generated by write_graphml, using read_graphml: **networkx.exception.NetworkXError: Bad GraphML data: no key d10**  On debugging, I found out an issue with write_graphml.  Below is a snippet from the code that can reproduce the error. If the datatype of _penalty_attr_ attribute passed to the add_edge function is different for different edges, write_graphml creates multiple data keys (in my example, _d10_) in graphml output file. There is no additional key information in the _<key>_ tag which only has description for keys upto _d9_, but _<edge>_ tag contains the extra key _d10_. This results in the key error while parsing graphml file using _read_graphml_.  ``` penalty_attr = '' if random() < 0.5:     penalty_attr = 1.0  #datatype: double  G.add_edge(from_node,            to_node,            penalty = py) ```  Please let me know if I need to rephrase or elaborate on the issue.
