Random expander#TITLE_END#### Discussed in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/6494  <div type='discussions-op-text'>  <sup>Originally posted by **fcrozatier** March 12, 2023</sup> There is no utility function to generate a random [expander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph) graph. I could fill a PR if there is interest.  Suggestion: It has been [proved](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0405020.pdf) that a random k-regular graph made of k/2 distinct permutations (k even) on {1,...,n} has probabilty $1 − O(n^{-τ})$ of being an expander, where $\tau$ is computable.  We could add a utility `maybe_expander(n,k)` that returns such a graph and the probability of it being an expander. For engineers this utility would be enough.   For mathematicians we could add an `is_regular_expander` utility and a slower `random_expander(n,k)` that loops over `maybe_expander` while not `is_regular_expander`. The `is_regular_expander` utility would be based on [Cheeger inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph#Cheeger_inequalities) for k-regular graphs (and the `is_regular` utility)</div>  I could work on this, let me know.
