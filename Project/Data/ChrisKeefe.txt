issue
DOC: scipy conf. citation links spin forever#TITLE_END#The PDF and BibTeX links [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/#citing) point to conference.scipy.org endpoints that never resolve. This is probably someone else's problem ™️, and I'm hoping you folks know who to check in with for a new URL or an upstream fix.  ### Current Behavior When I click the link, the target page never resolves, resulting in a Connection Timed Out error after a couple of minutes.  ### Expected Behavior I get a PDF or a BibTex file.  ### Steps to Reproduce Visit the citations section linked above, and click one of the affected links.  ### Environment OpenSUSE, Firefox/Chromium
issue
Use https links for conference.scipy.org#TITLE_END#The server reset from https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5433 fixed the resolution issues, but both Firefox and Chromium refuse to play nice with the .`bib` file on this machine, apparently because they're concerned with the insecurity of the `http:` target.   ![ff_not_downloaded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39198770/160680909-088938b7-a547-4aec-a45a-16cb6a1ad94e.png)  Both are happy to download the .bib from `https:...`. I've changed the PDF and .bib links to `https`.
