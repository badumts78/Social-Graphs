Modify from_pandas_dataframe to accept non-square inputs #TITLE_END#First PR, so let me say that NetworkX has been very useful in the past. Thanks!  I was looking at the dev docs and was happy to see that there is some work being done to handle Pandas DataFrames as inputs for graph creation (from_pandas_dataframe). Unfortunately (for me), the source looks to be a very thin wrapper around from_numpy_matrix. This doesn't work for the DataFrames I create, which are sparse and not square (Example below). This PR modifies from_pandas_dataframe in a way that accepts non-square DFs. What I've done is to create a generator function that takes a DataFrame and returns an [ebunch](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/development/reference/glossary.html#term-ebunch). The generator is passed to the `add_edges_from` constructor. This works fine for all shapes of DataFrame, including the square case that is already covered.  Tested Python 3.4 on Linux.  There's still a couple of problems... First of all, I wrote a test that follows the from_numpy_matrix tests. Unfortunately, I wasn't working on my machine because it couldn't find `np` and `pd`. Pointers?  Second, should this have flags to ignore zero and nan? Or should they just be ignored without asking?   Example: I might have a connectivity DataFrame that looks like the following (just made this up):  | donor | A | B | C | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | accept |  |  |  | | D | 2.7 | 0.4 | 0.3 | | E | 0.00 | 0.03 | 0 | | F | 0.00 | 0.7 | 2.1 | | G | 0.52 | 0 | 1.2 |  In this extreme example, there is not any overlap between the two sets and they are different lengths. I could [rebuild my DataFrame](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21207872/construct-networkx-graph-from-pandas-dataframe) to have the same columns and indices ; however, this is a bit of extra work and creates a very large table of empty values.   If the above Dataframe is stored in `df`, then the modified function will produce:  ``` G=nx.from_pandas_dataframe(df) print(G.edges(data=True)) ```  [('A', 'G', {'weight': 0.52000000000000002}),  ('A', 'D', {'weight': 2.7000000000000002}),  ('G', 'C', {'weight': 1.2}),  ('E', 'B', {'weight': 0.029999999999999999}),  ('B', 'F', {'weight': 0.69999999999999996}),  ('B', 'D', {'weight': 0.40000000000000002}),  ('F', 'C', {'weight': 2.1000000000000001}),  ('D', 'C', {'weight': 0.29999999999999999})]
