Shouldn't OrderedGraph.subgraph() preserve edge order?#TITLE_END#My expectation was that when running:  ``` python from __future__ import print_function from collections import OrderedDict from networkx import DiGraph  class OrderedGraph(DiGraph):     node_dict_factory = OrderedDict     adjlist_dict_factory = OrderedDict  g = OrderedGraph() g.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3]) # Note the relative order: 2 and 1 below! g.add_edges_from([(2, 3), (1, 3)]) print(list(g.pred[3])) g_sub = g.subgraph([1, 2, 3]) print(list(g_sub.pred[3])) ```  to see:  ``` [2, 1] [2, 1] ```  that is, the relative order of the predecessors will be the same in the subgraph but this is clearly not the case, as I get  ``` [2, 1] [1, 2] ```  In graph `g`, the relative order of nodes 1 and 2 is 1, 2 in the nodes, but 2, 1 in the predecessors; most likely this is the reason why I see this. I checked with b6b362a8cbd09e58ce44723747e4cdc2fed5f4e8.  **What is the intended behavior? Or am I using the `OrderedGraph` wrong?**  I am currently implementing reverse-mode automatic differentiation where the argument order of an operation, such as subtraction or division, has to be kept (`z=x-y` but in the subgraph I get`z=y-x` which is a disaster for me). Maybe I misunderstood what the `OrderedGraph` is meant to be used for.
