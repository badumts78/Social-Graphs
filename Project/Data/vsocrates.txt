issue
Edges from adjacency numpy array/matrix#TITLE_END#I have a node list and an adjacency matrix represented as a `np.ndarray`.  I've created a graph with nodes and attributes from the one-liner discussed in #4225 which seems to work great, but I can't find an easy way to integrate edges.   Instead, I could create a graph using `from_numpy_array` but then adding node attributes becomes difficult. To bridge this gap and taking into account previous discussion, I think changing `add_weighted_edges_from` to accept an adjacency matrix or possibly a new function called `add_weighted_edges_from_numpy_array` may be useful. I imagine it'd look something like this:   ``` def add_weighted_edges_from_numpy_array(g, nodelist, adj_mat): 	weights = [] 	i = j = 0 	for i in len(nodelist): 		for j in len(nodelist): 			weights.append((nodelist[i],nodelist[j],adj_mat[i,j]))  	g.add_weighted_edges_from(weights) 	return ```  I just wanted to know if such a function exists anywhere and I missed it. Otherwise I'd love to contribute it!
