Wrong load centrality implementation#TITLE_END#The implementation of load centrality does not seem to match the description of the centrality measure in the referenced paper. Instead load centrality just returns betweenness centrality values.    ### Current Behavior Load centrality implementation just returns betweenness centrality values  ### Expected Behavior the centrality measure should return load centraltiy measures as described in: Mark E. J. Newman: Scientific collaboration networks. II. Shortest paths, weighted networks, and centrality. Physical Review E 64, 016132, 2001. http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.016132   ### Steps to Reproduce When implementing the simple network as mentioned in the above paper different values for load and betweenness should be found  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.8.3   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
