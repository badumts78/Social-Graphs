issue
girvan_newman mistakenly thinks edge is not in graph?#TITLE_END#I am trying to run girvan_newman on my graph. I used the following code:  ``` import operator def get_edge(graph):     centrality = nx.edge_betweenness_centrality(graph, k=1000)     return(max(test.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))[0]) gn = nx.algorithms.community.centrality.girvan_newman(my_graph, get_edge) communities = [] counter = 0 while counter < 10:     communities.append(tuple(sorted(c) for c in next(gn)))     counter += 1 ``` However, this gives me an error: `NetworkXError: The edge 4704-4693 is not in the graph` I double checked and this edge definitely is in my graph, so I'm not sure what's going wrong here.
