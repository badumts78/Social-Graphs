Mimic behavior of pre-2.0 `connected_component_subgraphs`#TITLE_END#First, I want to say thank you for your awesome library!  I have created a subclass of the `networkx.Graph` class (let's call it `MyGraph`), and am trying to figure out how to mimc the behavior I used to see with pre-version-2.0 code. When I would call `connected_component_subgraphs(G)` on a `MyGraph` instance, each connected component returned would in turn be instantiated as a `MyGraph` instance with access to the custom data and methods I had defined.  Now with the new subgraph views I'm struggling to figure out how to instantiate each CC as a `MyGraph` instance.  From [this page](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.subgraph.html) I figured out that `G.subgraph(cc).copy()` will give the full graph node / edge structure. However, these revert to instances of `networkx.Graph` instead of `MyGraph`, so I lose access to the custom data and attributes.  Any pointers on how I can instantiate graph CCs as instances of `MyGraph`? Thanks.  The networkx functionality I rely on most is finding connected components. Previously when I would call `connected_component_subgraphs(G)`, it would return
