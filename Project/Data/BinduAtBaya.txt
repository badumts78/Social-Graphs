issue
list attributes are not copied on a union #TITLE_END# <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> create graph1 create graph2 update graph1 as union of graph1 and graph2 with rename update graph1 as union of graph 1 and graph2 with new rename list attributes of graph2 are not copied but referenced     ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce import networkx as nx G=nx.DiGraph() G.add_node("foo", unconn=["a","b","c"]) H=nx.DiGraph() H.add_node("bar", unconn=["a","b","c"]) H=nx.union(H,G,rename=('',"l1")) print(H.nodes(data=True)) H=nx.union(H,G,rename=('',"l2")) print(H.nodes(data=True)) H.nodes['l2foo']['unconn'].remove('a')  this will remove a from both nodes l2foo and l1foo <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: NetworkX version:  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
