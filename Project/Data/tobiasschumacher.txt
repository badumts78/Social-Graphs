issue
Loading graph from sparse matrix creates unwanted edges if matrix antires are 0.#TITLE_END#Hi,  when trying to simulate [Kronecker graph models](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/kronecker-jmlr10.pdf) with networkx, I ran into the following issue:  Computing the Kronecker product of two sparse (adjacency) matrices in scipy naturally yields sparse matrices which will also contain some "present" entries which are 0 (other than entries that are omitted in the sparse representation due to being zero).   When I then initialize a networkx graph from such a sparse matrix, these zero entries will then be interpreted as edges with weight zero, so in particular some edges will be added which should not be contained in the graph.  In consequence, I think the initialization of networks from sparse matrices should be updated, so that present zeros in the sparse adjacency matrix should also be interpreted as non-edges.  Here is an example of performing the same operations with numpy arrays and scipy sparse matrices, yielding diffrent graphs:  ```import numpy as np import networkx as nx from scipy import sparse  graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_edges_from([(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(1,0),(0,1),(1,2),(2,1)]) matrix = nx.to_numpy_matrix(graph)  M = sparse.csr_matrix(matrix) result_sparse = sparse.kron(M,M) result_np = np.kron(matrix,matrix)  graph_sparse = nx.Graph(result_sparse) graph_np = nx.Graph(result_np)  # This will print False: print(nx.is_isomorphic(graph_sparse, graph_np)) ```
