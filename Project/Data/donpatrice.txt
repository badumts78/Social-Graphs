subgraph fails when subclassing Graph with additional argument#TITLE_END#I run into problems when subclassing like this: ``` class MyGraph(nx.Graph):     def __init__(self, foo):         super().__init__()         self.foo = foo  mg = MyGraph(5) mg.__class__()  TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'foo' ```  And therefore mg.subgraph() will fail.  ``` edges = [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)] mg.add_edges_from(edges) mg.subgraph([1,2])  TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'foo' ````  Is there a way to bypass this.  I think this is related to https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2889 and https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3073

Neighbor information example from Graph.adj is not working#TITLE_END#The documentation for `Graph.adj` states:  > The neighbor information is also provided by subscripting the graph. So `for nbr, foovalue in G[node].data('foo', default=1):` works.  But this is not working. ```python G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]) colors = {0: 'red', 1: 'green', 2: 'blue'} nx.set_node_attributes(G, colors, 'colors') for nbr, foovalue in G[0].data('color'):     print(nbr, foovalue)  'AtlasView' object has no attribute 'data' ````  Do I misunderstand the usage or is this statement wrong.
