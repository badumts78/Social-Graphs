issue
Maximum recursion depth when computing the maximum independent set#TITLE_END#Hello,  I get a `RuntimeError` (maximum recursion depth exceeded) when using `maximum_independent_set()` on graphs with self-loops. Here's a small test case for reproducing this issue:  ```python from networkx.algorithms import approximation  g = networkx.DiGraph() g.add_node(1) g.add_node(2) g.add_node(3) g.add_edge(1, 2) g.add_edge(2, 2) g.add_edge(2, 3)  print approximation.independent_set.maximum_independent_set(g) ```  The problem seems to be in `ramsey_R2()`, but don't take my word for it as I haven't fully debugged the problem yet :-) Looks like the self-loop node always ends up in `nbrs` and, consequently, the recursion's termination condition is never reached.
