Transitive reduction is inefficient + improvement proposal#TITLE_END#I found that the current implementation of transitive reduction is very inefficient, while it can be solved in O(n^omega) assuming the transitive closure is known. In my own code I'm dealing with this as follows.  ```python import numpy as np import networkx as nx  g  # NetworkX DiGraph, assuming it's transitively closed (or first call nx.dag.transitive_closure(g)) m = nx.adjacency_matrix(g).todense().astype(bool)  # Conversion to dense may be slow. m &= ~(m @ m == m)  # When you can reach a node from another node in both 1 and 2 steps, remove arc. # Now create the digraph again, if needed. ```  I'd love to create a pull-request for a proposed different method, but this uses a conversion to a numpy dense adjacency matrix. Any information is discarded like labelling, and that's an unwanted side-effect. Also multi-edges are discarded.  What are your thoughts on this?
