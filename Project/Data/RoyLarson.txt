issue
Incidence Matrix Documentation is confusing#TITLE_END#First my networkx version is 2.4 In the incidence matrix documentation  it states if using the oriented option " A -1 appears for the tail of an edge and 1  for the head of the edge." This appears to be not true:  The table below shows has node and the edge with the edge in (source_node, destination_node) format.   In row 0, column 0 the edge specified is from node_0 to node_1.  As someone not familiar with the language I would interpret head to mean source, and tail to mean destination, so the value I would expect is 1 not -1.  I did not think of the head and tail as the head and tail of an arrow, which is why I was confused.  Can the documentation be modified to  " A -1 appears for the source (tail) of an edge and 1  for the destination (head) of the edge."  The table below can be reproduced by  ```python import pandas as pd import networkx as nx node_list = [f'node_{i}' for i in range(3)] G = nx.complete_graph(node_list, nx.DiGraph()) for i, edge in enumerate(G.edges, 1):     G.edges[edge]['weight'] = i ind_mat = pd.DataFrame(nx.incidence_matrix(G, oriented=True, weight='weight').toarray(), columns = list(G.edges), index=G.nodes) ind_mat ```   |        |   ('node_0', 'node_1') |   ('node_0', 'node_2') |   ('node_1', 'node_0') |   ('node_1', 'node_2') |   ('node_2', 'node_0') |   ('node_2', 'node_1') |   |:-------|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|   | node_0 |    -1 |    -2 |      3 |     0 |    5 |      0 |   | node_1 |     1 |      0 |     -3 |   -4 |    0 |      6 |   | node_2 |     0 |      2 |       0 |    4 |   -5 |     -6 |
