"robust" topological sort (does best it can when there are cycles)#TITLE_END#The existing version of networkx raises an exception [if topological_sort is called on a directed graph with cycles](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.dag.topological_sort.html).  I am not very familiar with graph theory so don't really know how to comment on this, but I am looking for an algorithm that does "the best it can", maybe leaving the nodes in a cycle in some order and doing a topological sort on the rest. [This article](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/blog/01208083168) allegedly uses an algorithm from Tarjan (which gives me some confidence that it has merit), with a fairly simple Python implementation posted.  Is there a way you could add a keyword `robust=False` to the `topological_sort()` method, and if `robust` is `True`, use this type of algorithm?
