issue
GML: strings are not properly quoted#TITLE_END#When I make an attribute that has a string that contains quotes `"`, and write it out using `write_gml`, the quotes are passed through unmodified, leading to problems parsing the GML file:  ``` >>> import sys, networkx as nx >>> G = nx.path_graph(1) >>> G.node[0]['demo'] = 'This has "extra quotes"' >>> nx.write_gml(G, sys.stdout) graph [   name "path_graph(1)"   node [     id 0     label 0     demo "This has "extra quotes""   ] ] ```  The `demo` line should read:  ```     demo "This has &quot;extra quotes&quot;" ```  In the [GML technical report (pdf)](http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/files/lehrstuhl/brandenburg/projekte/gml/gml-technical-report.pdf), it specifies that double-quotes and ampersands should be encoded with HTML escaping.  This is available easily in Python using `import cgi; cgi.escape(data, True)`  `read_gml` fails when reading the generated graph above, and also fails to decode character references - here's a SO question on doing this part - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1208916/decoding-html-entities-with-python
