Edge minimum capacity#TITLE_END#Hi,  As far as I can see the current branch do not support a minimum capacity feature for edges. It would be a very nice feature to have in a flow algorithm context especially for finance. For example when you look for an optimal trading path between forex pairs, you do need to implement a minimum order size.  The C++ lemon [lemon](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/doc/latest/a00269.html#aa0198dc86458cf5d9893eaac3875faff) library support this type of feature.

Question about flow solving with simplex algorithm#TITLE_END#See the code below:  ```python import networkx as nx G=nx.DiGraph() G.add_edge(1,2,capacity=7, weight=1) G.add_edge(2,3,capacity=5, weight=1) G.add_edge(2,4,capacity=4, weight=1) G.nodes[1]['demand']=-7 G.nodes[2]['demand']=0 G.nodes[3]['demand']=2 G.nodes[4]['demand']=5 _, flows = nx.network_simplex(G, 'demand', 'capacity', 'weight') print(flows) ``` It will raise the exception `networkx.exception.NetworkXUnfeasible: no flow satisfies all node demands` because edge (2,4) capacity is < 5. But there is still a valid flow 1->2->3 which satisfy demands and capacities.  Does anyone have an idea or a workaround for finding theses residual flows in case of unfeasible exception ?

nx.network_simplex returned flow dict is not ordered#TITLE_END#The code snippet below create a random digraph, set demand on some nodes and then print the computed flow dict: ```python  R = nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(10, 0.5, directed=True) nx.set_node_attributes(R, {7:{"demand":-7}, 3:{"demand":2}, 1:{"demand":-3}, 5:{"demand":3}, 6:{"demand":3}, 9:{"demand":2}}) nx.network_simplex(R, demand='demand', capacity='capacity', weight='weight')[1] {0: {1: 0, 3: 4, 7: 0}, 1: {2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 0}, 2: {0: 0, 1: 0, 3: 3, 7: 0}, 3: {1: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 3, 7: 0, 9: 2}, 4: {3: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0}, 5: {3: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}, 6: {0: 0, 4: 0, 7: 0}, 7: {0: 4, 1: 0, 5: 3, 6: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}, 8: {1: 0, 3: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0}, 9: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 8: 0}} ``` It seems the returned dict is based on the order of the nodes, but most of time is is not consistent with the resulting flow. On the example above, the first non null entry is about sending 4 from node 0 to node 3.  This issue is that node 0 is neither a sink or a source node.  The flow dict that respect order flow should be (without null values): ```python {7: {0: 4, 5: 3}, {0: {3: 4}, {1: {2: 3}, 2: {3: 3}, 3: {6: 3, 9: 2}} ````  Any idea how to make the output of network_simplex consistent with the flow order ?
comment
👍 Indeed. It would be great time complexity in docs especially for algorithm methods.
