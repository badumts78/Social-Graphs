issue
draw_networkx_edge_labels examples don't work with MultiDiGraphs#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> The canonical examples I seem to be able to find for drawing edge labels look something like this: ``` edge_labels = nx.get_edge_attributes(G, 'title') nx.draw(G) nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, edge_labels=edge_labels) nx.draw_networkx(G) plt.show() ```  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> When applied to a MultiDiGraph, the way in which this data is structured isn't supported by `draw_networkx_edge_labels`. You get something like the following exception:  ```         import matplotlib.pyplot as plt         import numpy as np              if ax is None:             ax = plt.gca()         if edge_labels is None:             labels = {(u, v): d for u, v, d in G.edges(data=True)}         else:             labels = edge_labels         text_items = {} >       for (n1, n2), label in labels.items(): E       ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2) ```  This is because the edge attributes on a MultiDiGraph are a 3-tuple which includes the key.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> The `draw_networkx_edge_labels` function should handle both the 2-tuple for single graphs and the 3-tuple case for multi graphs.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9 NetworkX version:   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
