Closeness_centrality uses 'distance' keyword, instead of weight:#TITLE_END#To conform with the rest of the networkx API, closeness_centrality should use the weight parameter to specify which edge attribute should be use to calculate the shortest path length, it shouldn't use distance.  http://networkx.github.com/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.closeness_centrality.html?highlight=closeness_centrality#networkx.algorithms.centrality.closeness_centrality

Directed (and weighted) clustering coefficient PR#TITLE_END#Dear all,  I worked on an implementation of the directed and weighted clustering coefficient using this reference:  http://web1.sssup.it/pubblicazioni/ugov_files/303163_PRE_2007.pdf  I wrote test code to confirm that in the weighted undirected, and unweighted undirected case this gives the exact same values as the current clustering coefficient formulas.  There is one point left to be discussed though - currently, clustering coefficient, is defined in two ways (fraction of total edges vs total possible edges, and fraction of total triangles vs total triangles), which, for the undirected case give the same answer.  For the directed case, however, the two definitions differ because of the presence of mutual edges.  The reference I listed explains why right after equation 8.  What normalization should I use?  Cytoscape normalizes by the fraction of possible edges for the directed case, but I don't know if that's an intentional choice.

[WIP]Small world coefficient#TITLE_END#This adds the small world coefficient, as described in:  Humphries MD, Gurney K (2008)     Network ‘Small-World-Ness’: A Quantitative Method for Determining Canonical     Network Equivalence.     PLoS ONE 3(4): e0002051. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0002051  This PR depends on my other PR for directed clustering coefficient, when calculating small worldness for directed graphs.  This PR also contains a small helper function, average_distance_weakly_connected to calculate the average shortest path across weakly connected graphs.  I could use some feedback here since the small world coefficient is defined in relation to random networks - this makes it somewhat expensive to calculate, and would slow down tests a fair bit.  Suggestions for efficient tests?

Linear Algebra Directed Clustering#TITLE_END#This PR adds a clustering coefficient measure for directed graph.  Currently, this PR uses the adjacency matrix representation to calculate clustering coefficient, and as such, it leverages numpy to do all the calculations and sits in the linear algebra module.  Using numpy, it's possible to write the formula in a manner very similar to that used in the original reference.  I also added two tests to show that in the undirected case, the module gives the same answer as the clustering coefficient function already present in networkx.  Possible improvements to this PR include the use of sparse matrix throughout, which however would preclude the use of syntax mirroring that of the paper.

Small world#TITLE_END#I've added code, docstring and tests for a few functions. - A linear algebra based implementation of the clustering coefficient, which also works for directed and weighted graphs.  Based on:   http://web1.sssup.it/pubblicazioni/ugov_files/303163_PRE_2007.pdf.  Tests also present for the weighted and unweighted undirected case. - A bootstrapping based implementation of the small world coefficient, using either clustering coefficient or transitivity.  Based on:   http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002051 - A average_shortest_path_length_weakly_connected function, calculating the average distance for weakly connected graphs, which correctly normalizes the average distance by the total number of actual paths present in the graph.  This is separate from average_shortest_path_length to preserve backward compatibility.  Tests also present.
