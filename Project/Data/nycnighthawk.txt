issue
all_shortest_paths inconsistent in undirected graph#TITLE_END#Steps to reproduce below >>> from networkx import nx >>> g = nx.Graph() >>> g.add_path([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8]) >>> g.add_path([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]) >>> g.edges[3,4]['weight'] = 0 >>> list(nx.all_shortest_paths(g, 1, 8, weight='weight')) [[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]] >>> list(nx.all_shortest_paths(g, 8, 1, weight='weight')) [[8, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]]  the result is correct for 1, 8, but incorrect for 8, 1 when associate the edge [3, 4] with weight=0, effectively means both paths are equal from calculation point of view.
