SMA* algorithm implementation #TITLE_END#The SMA* (Simplified Memory-Bounded A*) algorithm implementation for NetworkX is a sophisticated tool for efficient exploration of network structures. It supports both directed and undirected graphs and uses heuristics similar to A*.  SMA* is a memory-limited search algorithm that maintains the best partial paths in a priority queue. It uses a memory limit to ensure that only a manageable number of nodes are held in memory at any one time. When this memory limit is exceeded, SMA* prunes the node with the highest estimated cost (f = g + h) to stay within the limit and continue the search efficiently.  The algorithm employs a best-first search strategy, incorporating a customisable weight function and an optional Euclidean heuristic. It also ensures completeness and optimality within memory constraints by tracking explored paths via a lightweight backtracking mechanism. This approach is particularly effective for large graphs, balancing performance with controlled memory usage.  However, due to restrictions in the current environment, where importing external libraries such as psutil was not allowed, I had to remove dynamic memory management based on available system RAM. Instead, a fixed memory limit was used, which provides a predefined maximum number of nodes that can be processed. This change ensures that the algorithm will continue to work within reasonable memory constraints without the need for dynamic memory management or external dependencies.  Below, we have performed several tests comparing the A* algorithm with SMA*. Utilising graphs with 1,000,000 nodes, the execution time performance of both algorithms was found to be similar, with A* demonstrating a slight advantage of approximately one second. Additionally, SMA* exhibited superior memory management, maintaining consistent memory usage by dynamically pruning nodes when necessary, while A* can experience memory congestion on very large graphs.  <img width="1626" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 51 30"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d48bbec-e152-4711-8239-d18e8ecb926a" />
