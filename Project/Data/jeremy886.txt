issue
networkx 1.1 vs 2.0 gpickle#TITLE_END#I got a pickle file from network 1.1 but I couldn't open it under 2.0.  Interestingly, I tried all possible file formats (like json, gexf, gml etc.) but all failed in different ways. (mainly issues related to numpy.float64).  At the moment, I tried to use to transfer graphs by: from 1.1 old.nodes(data=True) old.edges(data=True)  Copy the output text to 2.0 new = nx.Graph() new.add_nodes_from(....) new.add_edges_from(....)  Is there a better way to solve this compatibility issue? Thanks.  [pickle file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwb0d1g035agneg/major_us_cities?dl=0)
