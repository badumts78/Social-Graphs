GDF file format support in readwrite#TITLE_END#This PR adds support for the GDF network file format via the functions `read_gdf`, `parse_gdf`, `write_gdf` and `dump_gdf`.  An old issue #455 exists for this but was closed at the time because the two main applications known to use this format - Gephi and GUESS - also support other formats that NetworkX can read/write. However, some of the research software we use (e.g. [4CAT](github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat)) only supports GDF, and support for it in NetworkX would make it easier for people to use the output of that software, and would allow us to integrate NetworkX's functionality in our tools.  This is my first PR for NetworkX so please tell me if extra work would be needed before it can be merged!
