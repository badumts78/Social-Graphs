single_source_all_shortest_paths: don't loop over all nodes#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior Currently, the function `single_source_all_shortest_paths` contains this line: ```python for n in G: ``` Which might be a significant waste of time if most nodes aren't reachable from the given source.  ### Expected Behavior Merely looping on the keys of `pred` could lead to a significant improvement for large very sparse graphs. ```python for n in pred: ```  And I guess the `try`-`except` in the loop is then no longer necessary.  ### Steps to Reproduce Here's an example that shows the performance issue. The more nodes in the graph, the slower, even if they are unreachable. Even though it might not be an issue for a single call to that function, when calling it on several sources, it quickly adds up. (See **Additional context** below.) ```python >>> import networkx as nx >>> g = nx.DiGraph() >>> g.add_edges_from((n, n+1) for n in range(1000000)) >>> nx.add_path(g, "ABZ") >>> nx.add_path(g, "ACZ") >>> nx.add_path(g, "ADZ") >>> dict(nx.single_source_all_shortest_paths(g, "A")) {'A': [['A']], 'B': [['A', 'B']], 'Z': [['A', 'B', 'Z'], ['A', 'C', 'Z'], ['A', 'D', 'Z']], 'C': [['A', 'C']], 'D': [['A', 'D']]} ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.12.8 NetworkX version: 3.2.1  ### Additional context Day 10 part 2 of Advent of Code has a graph with many small connected components and asks to find the number of paths from all the nodes marked `0` to all the nodes marked `9`. https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/10 As it turns out, calling `single_source_all_shortest_paths` for all source nodes is pretty slow and takes 1.5 seconds for me. With the proposed change, it only takes 50ms.
