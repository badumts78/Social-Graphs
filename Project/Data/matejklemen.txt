Fix A* returning wrong solution#TITLE_END#Fixes #3464.  The problem was that each node was allowed to be explored at most once, but sometimes, there are multiple paths through the same node, where the first one is not necessarily the best.   I fixed it by removing the checks for whether a node was already explored and adding logic to prevent the overriding of starting node's parent. The latter is required because when returning a path, that is done by backtracking until the node's parent is `None`. Without the check, the parent of starting node could be overridden and the backtracking would never end.  The added test contains a smaller version of the graph, mentioned in issue #3464.

Hey, in your example @dschult, I think the result is actually correct as you do not have an admissible heuristic (i.e. one that underestimates cost to the goal) and in that case A* is not guaranteed to find an optimal solution.  In the case of the main example, there actually seems to be a bug. As far as I can tell, the problem seems to be the checking of already explored nodes. It stores explored nodes in a dictionary, so when the same node is encountered twice, it does not explore the node again. In the example here, a "bad path" is found first (`n5`->`n1`->`n0`), which correctly gets put at the end of the priority queue (and is not yet fully explored!). The problem is though, that all other paths through `n1` do not get explored because `n1` in stored among the already explored nodes. Therefore, the "bad path" gets returned as solution.    I'll test it a bit more and see if I can come up with a PR.
