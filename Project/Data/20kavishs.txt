dfs_labeled_edges output doesn't make sense/is inconsistent with definitions#TITLE_END#The dfs_labeled_edges function returns some results that may be inconsistent. If not, then I think the documentation at https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.traversal.depth_first_search.dfs_labeled_edges.html should at least be updated  ### Current Behavior The best example is simply the one in the documentation: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.traversal.depth_first_search.dfs_labeled_edges.html  ``` from pprint import pprint G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)]) pprint(list(nx.dfs_labeled_edges(G, source=0))) ``` The above code outputs: ``` [(0, 0, 'forward'),  (0, 1, 'forward'),  (1, 2, 'forward'),  (2, 1, 'nontree'),  (1, 2, 'reverse'),  (0, 1, 'reverse'),  (0, 0, 'reverse')] ```  The definitions from the documentation are:   A ‘forward’ edge is one in which u has been visited but v has not. A ‘nontree’ edge is one in which both u and v have been visited but the edge is not in the DFS tree. A ‘reverse’ edge is one in which both u and v have been visited and the edge is in the DFS tree.   But then how is (0,1) both a reverse and forward edge? As it is, why is (0,0) a forward edge?   ### Expected Behavior Just needs to ensure correct classification of edges  ### Steps to Reproduce See above.   ### Environment Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version: 3.1
