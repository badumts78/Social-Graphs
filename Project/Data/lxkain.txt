issue
is my MST really the minimum?#TITLE_END#I'm doing:  ``` P = squareform(pdist(X)) graph = nx.Graph(P) tree = nx.minimum_spanning_tree(graph) edges = tree.edges(data=True)  plt.plot(X[:,0], X[:,1], 'b.') for i, j in tree.edges():     plt.plot(X[[i, j], 0], X[[i, j], 1], 'r') ```  which gives the attached plot. However, looking at the place where the tree bifurcates, it seems like there would be a better solution by connecting the two top dots. Bug? User error? Nearly-optimal algorithm? ![figure_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15930505/24009241/9976153e-0a31-11e7-9026-b1c35983796a.png) ?
