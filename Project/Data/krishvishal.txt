Making an nxn torus interconnect with networkx#TITLE_END#I'm trying to make a 2D dimensional torus interconnect using `networkx` library in python. I have achieved this using the following code in matlab.  ```matlab     %..points for grid....%     S=4;  % Side length of grid     N=S^2;    % Number of nodes in network          v1=[1:S];     [c1 c2]=meshgrid(v1,v1);          points(:,1)=2*c1(:);     points(:,2)=2*c2(:);     %...end of points for grid...%           D=squareform(pdist(points));   % Caluclate distances between points     D1=D+eye(N);          Dbin=D<RI;                      % Deciding conflicting nodes          %......Extra edges for torus.....%     for i=1:S         Dbin(i,i+(S-1)*S)=1;         Dbin(i+(S-1)*S,i)=1;                  Dbin(S*i,S*(i-1)+1)=1;         Dbin(S*(i-1)+1,S*i)=1;     end     %......Extra edges for torus.....% ```  I can do something similar in python using numpy, but I want to use `networkx` library. I don't know how to do this.   Edit:  I've created a square lattice using the following code. But have to figure out how to connect the peripheral edges as shown in the figure below.  ```python     import networkx as nx          G = nx.grid_graph(dim = [4,4]) ```  Is there a way to generalize this to an nxn grid with peripheral connections.  This is how the graph looks like. [![enter image description here][1]][1]     [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtUox.png
