k_clique_communities return communities included into each other#TITLE_END#In some particular cases, k_clique_communities algorithm can return a community whose nodes are totally included in another community. This is not a bug as it is a consequence of the definition of the algorithm, but since it is counterintuitive, I point it here.  Below, a minimal working example: ``` import networkx as nx g = nx.Graph() g.add_edges_from([(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)]) g.add_edges_from([(1,4),(1,5),(2,6),(2,7),(3,8),(3,9)]) for i in range(4,10):     for j in range(i+1,10):         g.add_edge(i,j) list(nx.algorithms.community.k_clique_communities(g,k=3)) ``` ----- =>`[frozenset({1, 2, 3}), frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9})]`
