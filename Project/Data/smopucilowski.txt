Allow grid_graph generator to accept tuple dim argument#TITLE_END#This refactors the grid_graph() generator to accept both a tuple as well as a list argument for its dimension argument.

Enhancement: add collective influence measure#TITLE_END#A new paper by Morone & Makse appearing in Nature a few days ago (doi:10.1038/nature14604) introduced the concept of Collective Influence. Briefy: this node measure quantifies the influence of a node by finding an optimal (minimal) set of structural influencers. Nodes with high collective influence, when removed, break down the network into many disconnected pieces.  This pull request implements their node measure.

Flows on forests return unconnected components as reachable/unreachable#TITLE_END#Suppose we have a DiGraph G with multiple connected components.  Invoking minimum_cut(), for example, on G, where source and sink nodes are only connected to one component, returns a cut_value and partition.  Although the cut_value is correct, the partition (a tuple containing reachable and unreachable from the source node) incorrectly adds components disconnected from source or sink (i.e. no path exists).  This is due to naive computation of the partition, e.g. networkx/algorithms/flow/maxflow.py:477-481  ``` python     # Then, reachable and non reachable nodes from source in the     # residual network form the node partition that defines     # the minimum cut.     non_reachable = set(nx.shortest_path_length(R, target=t))     partition = (set(G) - non_reachable, non_reachable) ``` 
comment
I don't think introducing a new dependency on scikit just for spectral clustering is wise, especially when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors is part of numpy; see http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.165.9323
