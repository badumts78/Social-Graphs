Fixes #4275 - Add comment to parallel betweenness example#TITLE_END## Description  Add comment about single core CI/CD showing slower parallel output in example script.  Added text:  ``` Note: The example output below shows that the non-parallel implementation is faster. This is a limitation of our CI/CD pipeline running on a single core.  Depending on your setup, you may observe a 4x speed improvement. ```  Following the discussion in the ticket, I left the multiprocessing as-is because I think it probably makes MORE sense than using concurrent.futures.  Here was my output running the script:  ``` ⇒  python examples/algorithms/plot_parallel_betweenness.py  Computing betweenness centrality for: Name: Type: Graph Number of nodes: 1000 Number of edges: 2991 Average degree:   5.9820 	Parallel version 		Time: 0.7211 seconds 		Betweenness centrality for node 0: 0.00201 	Non-Parallel version 		Time: 3.0109 seconds 		Betweenness centrality for node 0: 0.00201  Computing betweenness centrality for: Name: Type: Graph Number of nodes: 1000 Number of edges: 5018 Average degree:  10.0360 	Parallel version 		Time: 0.8089 seconds 		Betweenness centrality for node 0: 0.00283 	Non-Parallel version 		Time: 3.8002 seconds 		Betweenness centrality for node 0: 0.00283  Computing betweenness centrality for: Name: Type: Graph Number of nodes: 1000 Number of edges: 2000 Average degree:   4.0000 	Parallel version 		Time: 0.6724 seconds 		Betweenness centrality for node 0: 0.02636 	Non-Parallel version 		Time: 2.6978 seconds 		Betweenness centrality for node 0: 0.02636 ```  <!-- Please run black to format your code.

Opened a PR, #4926, adding a comment about the sphinx performance output vs. running locally. LMK what you think. I think `multiprocessing`, while less performant in the CI/CD, is probably faster for developers using `networkx` than `concurrent.futures`, as graph size increases.

Thanks! Apologies for delay in responding, dealing with family emergency. Might consider adding concurrent.futures example in future PR  On Mon, Jun 28, 2021 at 1:48 PM Dan Schult ***@***.***> wrote:  > Closed #4275 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4275> via > 232decb > <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/232decb41a1bda1c70d37dbb1f3541dcca104ab6> > . > > — > You are receiving this because you commented. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub > <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4275#event-4949792148>, or > unsubscribe > <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABIJPHRBK3XGLNNWTLZST43TVDNZRANCNFSM4S37RAXQ> > . >
