Wrong Katz centrality for directed graphs#TITLE_END#Hi,  the Katz centrality for directed graphs uses the outgoing links instead of the incoming links:  ``` for n in x:      for nbr in G[n]:         x[n] += xlast[nbr] * G[n][nbr].get(weight,1) ```  As such the centrality is computed correctly only for undirected graphs.

Bug fix for the fast_gnp_random_graph() random graph generator#TITLE_END#This fixes a bug in generators/random_graphs.py for the fast_gnp_random_graph() generator. This generator is a fast version of Erdős-Rényi graphs based on the pseudocode in [1]. However, for directed graphs this never generated edges adjacent to the first network node (index 0). A simple adaption of line 90 suffices to change this. I changed     v = 1 to     v = 0.  This has no influence on the undirected graph generator, where the first loop iteration will then simply increase 0 to 1. For the directed version, this allows for the possibility to attach edges to the first node (index 0).  I've also incorporated a probabilistic test case for this, as well as refactored the test cases and made some PEP 8 whitespace changes.
