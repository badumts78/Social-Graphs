Full join operation and cograph generator#TITLE_END#A cograph is a graph containing no path on four vertices. Cographs or $P_4$-free graphs can be obtained from a single vertex by disjoint union and complementation operations.  The generator starts of from a single vertex and performes disjoint union and full join operations on itself at each iteration. The decision on which operation will take place is random.  Full join is the union of G and H in which all edges between G and H are added. The full join operation of two graphs G and H is the same as getting their complement, performing a disjoint union, and finally getting the complement of the resulting graph.  This PR adds the cograph generator and the full join operation.  Reference on cographs: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X81900135?via%3Dihub

Binomial trees generator#TITLE_END#Recent research has been developed on binomial trees and networkx doesn't have a generator yet. So here it is my contribution on generating binomial trees.

> Interesting, the test that is failing @ CI passes locally  Will investigate.  It only happens with Python 3.7.0 upon x32 arch.
