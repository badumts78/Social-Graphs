issue
single_source_shortest_path_length does not contain all nodes#TITLE_END#I was seeing sporadic failures on the [hvplot network docs](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/user_guide/NetworkX.html) and realized that `single_source_shortest_path_length` does not always return a dict of the same length as `G`. I assume this is a bug.  ## Minimal example  Note that the failure is transient. I am seeing it about once every 3 times, so you might need to run the following snippet several times to see the behavior.  ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.random_geometric_graph(200, 0.125) p = nx.single_source_shortest_path_length(G, 0)  print(len(G) , len(p)) ```  I am on networkx version 2.4
