Extended Barabasi-Albert Model#TITLE_END#The aim of this pull request is to include a new random graph model in the library. The model is described as extended Barabási–Albert model.  As described in "Albert, R., & Barabási, A. L. (2000). Topology of evolving networks: local events and universality. Physical review letters, 85(24), 5234.", the model introduces some probabilities. Based on the probabilities 'p' and 'q' with (p+q) < 1, the growing behavior of the graph is determined as follows:          1) With 'p' probability, 'm' new edges are added to the graph,      starting from randomly chosen existing nodes and attached preferentially at the other end.          2) With 'q' probability, 'm' existing edges are rewired     by randomly chosing an edge and rewiring one end to a preferentially chosen node.          3) With (1-p-q) probability, 'm' new nodes are added to the graph, with edges attached preferentially (using preferential attachment: a new node is more likely to connect to an existing node with a high node degree).          And when p=q=0,the model behaves just like Barabasi-Albert model.  a method called _extended_barabasi_albert_graph_ is added to the file _networkx/random_graphs.py_ and a unit testing method _test_extended_barabasi_albert_ is added to the file _networkx/generators/test_random_graphs.py_.
