Hi,  I had the same problem and the workaround worked nicely :) I originally found [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22124793/colorbar-for-edges-in-networkx). I will add the workaround there as well if you dont mind.  Is the core issue worth revisiting and fixable (may be upstream)? The workaround isnt quite convenient and I dont know if new users will find the answer as easily.  Currently I'm using matplotlib 3.5.1 and networkx 2.6.3.  Greetings Julian

Wow! Thanks for the quick reply! Yeah, that's what [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53070467) answer suggests. However then you dont get arrows. Why isn't it possible to get arrows and make it work without a workaround? What changes would be necessary? I think documentation is important and the networkx docs are amazing, but in this case wouldn't it be better to have is just work without special cases?

For me it's not about the amount of lines of code of the workaround, but about the friction using networkx. In the end a workaround will be copied either way, so it doesnt matter if its 3 lines or 10 lines, but it will definitely take the developer out of the flow and send him/her on a google spree.  Another idea would be to give `draw_networkx_edges` the argument `cbar` like [`seaborn.heatmap`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) does and handle both cases internally.
