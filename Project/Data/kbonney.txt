Return type of draw_networkx_nodes is incorrect#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior Current behavior is that the `draw_networkx_nodes` function returns a matplotlib Axis object.   ### Expected Behavior Expected behavior is that the `draw_networkx_nodes` function returns a matplotlib `PathCollection` object. This is the previous behavior of the function and is what the docstring reports:  ```     Returns     -------     matplotlib.collections.PathCollection         `PathCollection` of the nodes. ```  ### Steps to Reproduce Below is a code snippet which demonstrates the bug. ``` import networkx as nx from matplotlib.collections import PathCollection  G = nx.dodecahedral_graph() nodes = nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G))  assert isinstance(nodes, PathCollection) ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.10.15 NetworkX version: 3.2.1  ### Additional context I started a PR to address this issue here: #7685  
issue
Fix draw_networkx_nodes return type#TITLE_END#This PR addresses #7684 by returning the collection object rather than axis object in `draw_networkx_nodes`. Additional tests are added to check that the return types of `draw_networkx_nodes` and `draw_networkx_edges` return expected types.
