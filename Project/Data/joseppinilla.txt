issue
Implemented multipartite_layout#TITLE_END#With so many layered networks being used, I thought it'd be nice having a way of easily drawing them using networkx.  I based this off of the bipartite_layout, and using the fact that multipartite graphs are already being created with the 'subset' key. 
issue
Fix edge_color inconsistency with node_color and description.#TITLE_END#Both draw_networkx_nodes and draw_networkx_edges support RGB or RGBA tuples. Fixes #3394 
issue
Parameter edge_color is inconsistent with node_color and description#TITLE_END#When using draw_networkx_nodes and draw_networkx_edges, the formats supported for the colors (node_color and edge_color) by the two methods are inconsistent. The description of the node_color and edge_color parameters is also inconsistent with what is supported.  This is OK, although RGBA is not mentioned as a supported format: ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.complete_graph(5) nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, nx.spring_layout(G), node_color=(0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0)) nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, nx.spring_layout(G), edge_color='r') ```  This throws an error: ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.complete_graph(5) nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, nx.spring_layout(G), node_color=(0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0)) nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, nx.spring_layout(G), edge_color=(0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0)) ```  [matplotlib.pyplot.scatter](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) says:  > Note that c should not be a single numeric RGB or RGBA sequence because that is indistinguishable from an array of values to be colormapped. If you want to specify the same RGB or RGBA value for all points, use a 2-D array with a single row. Otherwise, value- matching will have precedence in case of a size matching with x and y.
comment
This also applies to nodes. I think this should change and I can make it part of the change in [PR #3395](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3395).  It would allow three different modes: Global alpha List of alphas *RGBA values in `edge_color `(or `node_color`)  *Currently overridden by the default alpha=1.0, which is unexpected behaviour.  @haiyangdeperci can you take a look at [PR #3395](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3395)?
