issue
read_gml fails on python 3 due to chr/unichr issues#TITLE_END#From what I've seen there is no official support for python 3.x yet, but I've been working with networkx on python 3.4 without issues, well, until now: When I try to read a previously created GML file using `networkx.read_gml(file)`, I get this exception  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   (...)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 125, in read_gml     G = parse_gml(lines, relabel=relabel)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 174, in parse_gml     data = "".join(lines)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 124, in <genexpr>     lines = (unescape(line.decode('ascii')) for line in path)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 79, in unescape     return re.sub("&#?\w+;", fixup, text)   File "/usr/lib/python3.4/re.py", line 175, in sub     return _compile(pattern, flags).sub(repl, string, count)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 69, in fixup     return unichr(int(text[2:-1])) NameError: name 'unichr' is not defined ```  I couldn't figure out whether this whole `unichr`/`chr`-thing between python 2 and 3 can be somehow resolved, but if there is an easy way to do it, I'd love to see an update. If someone can point me in the right direction here, I can try to fix it myself and create a pull request.
