I'd love to.  I actually used networkx to check that the implementation was sound and found a bug in the description of their algorithm (I emailed them and they corrected it in v2 of the paper).  As most of the time is spent in computing set intersections, Python actually does an amazing job of implementing this and in fact my Python times were faster than their C times for some of the test cases :)  The only snag is that they have politely asked me to delete the github repository until they have had a chance to publish the paper.  They have said they will let me know when they are happy for me to put it back.  Once this happens I will also try to prepare a pull request for networkx.  As it stands their algorithm just returns the maximum size.  I assume that it would be more useful to return an actual instance of a set of nodes with the max clique size.  (Or perhaps even use yield to produce an iterator over all max cliques?)  I think these changes are quite easy to add to their algorithm although I haven't done so yet.
