.gexf graph read/write converts edge start and end dates attributes  to attvalues element#TITLE_END#This pertains to dynamic graphs read/written in the `.gexf` format.  Consider the following:    ``` bash $ cat dynamic_network.gexf <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <gexf xmlns="http://www.gexf.net/1.2draft" version="1.2">     <graph mode="dynamic" timeformat="date">         <nodes>             <node id="0" />             <node id="1" />         </nodes>         <edges>             <edge id="0" source="0" target="1" start="2009-03-01" end="2009-03-10"/>         </edges>     </graph> </gexf> $ python >>> import networkx as nx >>> g = nx.read_gexf('dynamic_network.gexf') >>> nx.write_gexf(g, 'dynamic_network_out.gexf') >>> quit() $ cat dynamic_network_out.gexf <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><gexf version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.gexf.net/1.1draft" xmlns:viz="http://www.gexf.net/1.1draft/viz" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">   <graph defaultedgetype="undirected" mode="static">     <attributes class="edge" mode="dynamic">       <attribute id="0" title="start" type="string" />       <attribute id="1" title="end" type="string" />     </attributes>     <nodes>       <node id="1" label="None" />       <node id="0" label="None" />     </nodes>     <edges>       <edge id="0" source="1" target="0">         <attvalues>           <attvalue for="0" value="2009-03-01" />           <attvalue for="1" value="2009-03-10" />         </attvalues>       </edge>     </edges>   </graph> </gexf> ```  At some stage between the graph being deserialized from file with `read_gexf()` and serialized back to file with `write_gexf()`, networkx converts the `start` and `end` attributes of the `edge` element to an `attvalues` element applied to the same edge.

Fixes #1275#TITLE_END#I'm not familiar with the documentation standards for functions in networkx, though have noticed other functions which seem to also try and manually duplicate in writing the default values already implied in the function signature.  If the networkx project is interested in moving away from that redundancy I can look to clean up the documentation elsewhere under a separate new issue.  Let me know.

average_clustering  count_zeros parameter True by default but stated as False in docstring #TITLE_END#Compare:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/a822b491c6b53a2819915a8c620e97a36ba6c060/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py#L117  with:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/a822b491c6b53a2819915a8c620e97a36ba6c060/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py#L139  The former gives the correct indication that `count_zeros` is `True` by default, while the latter which one might come across while browsing the documentation suggests incorrectly the opposite i.e. that `count_zeros` is `False` by default.  I'd suggest that documenting the default value manually in the docstring is redundant anyway and so should be omitted completely rather than corrected to read `True`.  I can fix this. 
issue
Fixes #928#TITLE_END#The existing implementation of `.gexf` serialization/deserialization exhibited several issues with reading and writing the graph's `mode` attribute, leading to dynamic graphs always being interpreted as static graphs.  This fix addresses these issues.  I have removed the `mode` parameter that was being passed to `GEXFWriter`'s constructor as the mode seems like an attribute that should be stored on the graph itself (which it now is) and `write_gexf` was not passing through a value for `mode` to the constructor anyway.    There were several cases where data attributes pertaining to the mode of the graph were being defined but not used, which I've replaced with instance variables. 
issue
Gephi writer outputs static graph even when graph is dynamic#TITLE_END#This pertains to serializing a networkx graph to the Gephi `.gexf` format.  Calling `write_gexf` on a networkx graph will always output the graph `mode` as `static`, which is an issue when the graph mode is actually `dynamic`.  The implementation of `write_gexf` (`networkx/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py`) minus any comments is:  ``` python def write_gexf(G, path, encoding='utf-8',prettyprint=True,version='1.1draft'):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             writer = GEXFWriter(encoding=encoding,prettyprint=prettyprint,                                                                                                                                                version=version)                                                                                                                                                      writer.add_graph(G)                                                                                                                                                                       writer.write(path)  ```  `GEXFWriter`'s `__init__` has an optional graph mode parameter; see the method signature below:  ``` python     def __init__(self, graph=None, encoding="utf-8",                                                                                                                                                       mode='static',prettyprint=True,                                                                                                                                                           version='1.1draft'):    ```  `write_gexf` does not specify the mode when instantiating `GEXFWriter` though and so the default value of `static` is always used, and, `__init__` sets `self.mode=mode`.  The following call to `writer.add_graph(G)` ultimately uses `self.mode` to determine what gets written to the output XML, and so the `mode` attribute of the graph always shows as `static` in the output.  A quick fix would be to `i)` add a `mode` parameter to `write_gexf` allowing the user to specify the graph type and `ii)` pass the argument through to the instantiation of `GEXFWriter`.  The problem with this is that it leaves it up to the user to supply the correct graph type at the time `write_gexf` is called.  A more appropriate fix is probably to store the mode as an attribute of the networkx graph and use this to determine the value of `mode` as it appears in the output XML.  This also means `mode` should be removed as a parameter to `GEXFWriter's` `__init__` call. 
issue
Fixes #885#TITLE_END#This is designed to fix both reading and writing of edge spells (and deprecated edge slices) on `.gexf` format graphs.    The existing `add_spells` and `add_slices` methods are sufficiently generic in implementation to support serialization/deserialization of spells/slices for both nodes and edges and as such remain _functionally_ unchanged.  Parameter names for the `add_spells` and `add_slices` methods have been changed in several instances though, to reflect the handling of either nodes _or_ edges.  For example, `def add_spells(self,node_element,node_data):` becomes  `def add_spells(self,node_or_edge_element,node_or_edge_data):`.  Calls to the relevant `add_spells`/`add_slices` methods have been added during both deserialization of a `.gexf` graph file's edges to networkx format (read) and during serialization of a networkx graph's edges to a `.gexf` file format (write).  Below is an example Gephi `.gexf` file **some_file.gexf**.  I illustrate the difference in output between the current networkx implementation and the implementation with this fix applied, assuming that **some_file.gexf** is read in with networkx and written straight out again:  **some_file.gexf**:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <gexf xmlns="http://www.gexf.net/1.2draft" version="1.2">     <graph mode="dynamic" timeformat="date">         <nodes>             <node id="0">                 <spells>                     <spell start="2009-01-01" end="2009-01-15" />                     <spell start="2009-01-30" end="2009-02-01" />                 </spells>             </node>             <node id="1">             </node>         </nodes>         <edges>             <edge id="0" source="0" target="1">                 <spells>                     <spell start="2009-01-01" end="2009-01-15" />                     <spell start="2009-01-30" end="2009-02-01" />                 </spells>             </edge>         </edges>     </graph> </gexf> ```  Reading `some_file.gexf` and immediately writing back out to some other file with _existing_ networkx implementation (missing edge spells):  ``` ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><gexf version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.gexf.net/1.1draft" xmlns:viz="http://www.gexf.net/1.1draft/viz" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">   <graph defaultedgetype="undirected" mode="static">     <nodes>       <node id="1" label="None" />       <node id="0" label="None">         <spells>           <spell end="2009-01-15" start="2009-01-01" />           <spell end="2009-02-01" start="2009-01-30" />         </spells>       </node>     </nodes>     <edges>       <edge id="0" source="1" target="0" />     </edges>   </graph> </gexf> ```  Reading `some_file.gexf` and immediately writing back out to some other file with _fixed_ networkx implementation (edge spells appear):  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><gexf version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.gexf.net/1.1draft" xmlns:viz="http://www.gexf.net/1.1draft/viz" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">   <graph defaultedgetype="undirected" mode="static">     <nodes>       <node id="1" label="None" />       <node id="0" label="None">         <spells>           <spell end="2009-01-15" start="2009-01-01" />           <spell end="2009-02-01" start="2009-01-30" />         </spells>       </node>     </nodes>     <edges>       <edge id="0" source="1" target="0">         <spells>           <spell end="2009-01-15" start="2009-01-01" />           <spell end="2009-02-01" start="2009-01-30" />         </spells>       </edge>     </edges>   </graph> </gexf> ```  Finally as a side note, there are some bugs with other aspects of `.gexf` serialization/deserialization.  For example, the serialized output graph `mode` attribute is `static`.  i.e. it is not honouring the `dynamic` graph mode specified in the input file.  This, and a few other issues are orthogonal to the fix under consideration though and I will create separate issues for them.
