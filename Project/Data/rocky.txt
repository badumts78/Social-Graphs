binomial_tree() with "create_using parameter#TITLE_END#Fixes #4460  <!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  <!-- this has been done. --> 
issue
Allow binomial_tree() to create directed graphs (via create_using parameter)#TITLE_END#`binomial_tree() ` doesn't seem to allow the `create_using` parameter to get passed and as a result, one can't create a directed binomial graph.   This seem like a inadvertent omission and easy to fix. I will put in a PR to address this soon.
