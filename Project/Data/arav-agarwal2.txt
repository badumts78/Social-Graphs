read_edgelist not reading all lines of write_edgelist file#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  For a graph analysis I am doing, I am using nx.write_edgelist(G,path=path) to write to the following file.  [A2_early_0.04.15.txt](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/6893893/A2_early_0.04.15.txt)  However, reading this data through nx.readwrite.edgelist.read_edgelist(filename, create_using=nx.DiGraph())  causes a problem, as not all data is read.   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> Reads in 617 edges of the above adjacency list   ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> Expect to read all 780 edges  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  G = nx.readwrite.edgelist.read_edgelist(filename, create_using=nx.DiGraph())  print(G.number_of_edges)  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8.5 NetworkX version: 2.5.1   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
