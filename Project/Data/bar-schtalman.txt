issue
Some tests cancelled automatically even though all tests passed#TITLE_END#Pull request [Pull request](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6376)  I recently made some changes to the code and submitted a pull request. The pull request passed all tests.  However, when I made some additional changes and attempted to commit them, I noticed that some of the tests were cancelled automatically. These tests had passed during the previous pull request, and I did not receive any error messages or notifications about why they were cancelled.  I've reviewed my changes and verified that they should not have affected the tests that were cancelled. I suspect that there may be a problem with the testing system or the underlying infrastructure.  Steps to reproduce:  Make changes to the code and attempt to commit them.  Observe that some tests are cancelled automatically, even though they passed during the previous pull request.   Expected behavior:  All tests should pass or fail based on their actual results, and should not be cancelled automatically without a clear reason.  Actual behavior:  Some tests are cancelled automatically, even though they passed during the previous pull request, and there is no clear reason why they were cancelled.   Environment:  Operating system: Mac os Programming language: Python
