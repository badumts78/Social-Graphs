issue
Paralleled edges are overlapping on each other#TITLE_END#As mentioned, when I am trying to draw a DiGraph with something like A ---> B and B --- >A, and each edge has different weight, these two edges are overlapping on each other.   Here is the code  ``` plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))  DG=nx.DiGraph() DG.add_weighted_edges_from([     (1,2,0.5),      (3,1,0.75),     (3,4,2),     (4,3,0.2), ])  pos = nx.circular_layout(DG)  nx.draw_networkx_nodes(     DG,      pos,      node_size=700,      node_color='pink' )  edge_list = [(u,v) for (u,v,d) in DG.edges(data=True)] nx.draw_networkx_edges(     DG,      pos,      edgelist=edge_list,     width=3,      alpha=0.5,      edge_color='b',      style='dashed' )  nx.draw_networkx_labels(     DG,      pos,      font_size=20,      font_family='sans-serif' )  label_list = dict([((u,v), d['weight']) for (u,v,d) in DG.edges(data=True)]) nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(     DG,      pos,     edge_labels = label_list )   plt.axis('off') plt.show() ```
