issue
multiple_source_shortest_path_length#TITLE_END#I'm working on a project for which I had to write a method to calculate the path length from _multiple_ sources to all other accessible nodes in the graph. I'd be happy to try and port it into networkx but, before I do, I wanted to be sure this was of interest.  The `multiple_source_shortest_path_length` function has basically the same signature as `single_source_shortest_path_length` except that it takes an iterable of nodes instead of a single node.  I'd be happy to add `multiple_source_shortest_path` too if that would be useful as both of these functions have very similar behavior.
