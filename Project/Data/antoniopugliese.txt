Directed Laplacian#TITLE_END#Question as in [this pull request](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/741#issuecomment-289179061)  ( #741 ).  The `directed_laplacian_matrix` function is actually a `normalized_directed_laplacian_matrix` function. This function uses the normalized formula L = I - (\Phi^{1/2} P \Phi^{-1/2} + \Phi^{-1/2} P^T \Phi^{1/2} ) / 2  For a correct `directed_laplacian_matrix` the combinatorial formula should be used L = \Phi - (\Phi P + P^T \Phi) / 2 This new function can be named `directed_combinatorial_laplacian_matrix` as suggested by @aweinstein.  The two formulas are obtained from the same paper: Fan Chung (2005). Laplacians and the Cheeger inequality for directed graphs. Annals of Combinatorics, 9(1), 2005 ([available here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/wp/dichee.pdf)).

Question:  Shouldn't the directed_laplacian_matrix function be a normalized_directed_laplacian_matrix function? This function uses the normalized formula L = I - (\Phi^{1/2} P \Phi^{-1/2} + \Phi^{-1/2} P^T \Phi^{1/2} ) / 2  For a directed_laplacian_matrix the combinatorial (non normalized) formula should be used L = \Phi - (\Phi P + P^T \Phi) / 2  What do you people think about this modification? I am also new to Github, so sorry if there is another way to have you notice this.

@aweinstein @jfinkels  The paper just calls it "Laplacian", but as you can see the formula has a "L" in math cursive, which is used for the normalized Laplacian. Also, in the documentation of the function is reported that the function returns a normalized matrix.  I like the `directed_combinatorial_laplacian_matrix` name. I used this name in the issue I just created.
