Controllability of Complex Network ? #TITLE_END#The controllability of complex network has been a hot research topic, is there someone developing  related algorithms, for example, calculate the number of Driver Node N_D using bipartite matching or using max multiplicity method ?   More details about these algorithms, refer to  [1] Liu, Y. Y., Slotine, J. J., & Barabási, A. L. (2011). Controllability of complex networks. Nature, 473(7346), 167-173.

Current-flow betweenness for directed graphs Exception ? #TITLE_END#Hi guys  Did networkx provides algorithms for calculating the node (or edge) current-flow betweenness for _**directed graphs**_?  I have try to call the function `edge_current_flow_betweenness_centrality`, but it raises a Exception saying "not working for directed graphs", but the document  > edge_current_flow_betweenness_centrality(G, normalized=True, weight=’weight’, dtype=<type ‘float’>, solver=’full’) > Compute current-flow betweenness centrality for edges. > Current-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current model for information spreading in contrast to betweenness centrality which uses shortest paths. > Current-flow betweenness centrality is also known as random-walk betweenness centrality 36. > **Parameters** > - **G** (graph) – A NetworkX graph > - normalized (bool, optional (default=True)) – If True the betweenness values are normalized >   by 2/[(n-1)(n-2)] where n is the number of nodes in G. > - **weight** (string or None, optional (default=’weight’)) – Key for edge data used as the >edge >   weight. If None, then use 1 as each edge weight. > - **dtype** (data type (float)) – Default data type for internal matrices.

Perhaps, this exception should be noted in the document ? something like _**Raise Exception: if graph is not undirected**_
