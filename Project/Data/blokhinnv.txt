issue
added extra condition for fancy arrow colors#TITLE_END#While working with edge colors I found the following problem.  Suppose we have a simple undirected graph with loops. We want to draw it with specified `edge_color` argument as follows:  ```python edges = [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2)] edge_colors = ['pink', 'cyan', 'black', 'red', 'blue', 'green'] H = nx.Graph() H.add_edges_from(edges) nx.draw(H, edgelist=edges, edge_color=edge_colors, with_labels=True) ``` With `networkx` version `2.7.2rc1.dev0` we will have quite a strange result (colors of loops do not match the declared colors):  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36994200/159562495-5571baad-c2ae-43cc-aef0-b5d7ad57225f.png)  The problem is [this part of ](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/6a0b4faf09ec9d3d40ad93e2ec9b431d6bab5dc4/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L885) the `draw_networkx_edges`  function where we redefine `edge_pos`. So when we call the function `_draw_networkx_edges_fancy_arrow_patch` we skip both conditions `len(arrow_colors) == len(edge_pos)` and `len(arrow_colors) == 1` and cycle through colors. This wouldn't have been a problem if we hadn't defined colors for those loops but if we do, the result seems to be incorrect.  I suggest to change the function so we get the result like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36994200/159563759-362f9083-f71d-4767-a8f3-39af744bb203.png)
