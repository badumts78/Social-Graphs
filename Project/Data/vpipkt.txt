Fix: Louvain limit iterations in `_one_level`#TITLE_END#We used `louvain_communities` on a large number of graphs and found that 99.99% of cases it worked well. But in a small set of inputs we found the Louvain community algorithm failed to converged. This manifests as a long running process because the execution is stuck in an infinite loop.  With some debug logging in place we see that for certain inputs, `networkx.algorithms.community.louvain._one_level` will keep moving the same node between the same two communities, and never exit the loop `while nb_moves > 0`.   This PR adds a unit test with one such graph and also proposes to break out of the loop if the number of moves exceeds the number of nodes ** 1.2.
