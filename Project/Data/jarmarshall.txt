issue
metric_closure will throw KeyError with unconnected graph#TITLE_END#Suggest checking connectedness with `nx.is_connected()` on entry to `metric_closure()` and throwing a more informative error if not.
comment
Thanks, this is great functionality, but you assume the graph supplied is connected, which may not be the case... see issue #2979
