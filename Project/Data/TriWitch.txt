issue
directed fast_gnp_random_graph generates no edges originating in first node#TITLE_END#Calling fast_gnp_random_graph(N,p,directed=True) results in graphs in which the first node "0" never has out_edges.  MWS:  ``` import networkx as nx G=nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(1000,0.1,directed=True) print G.out_edges(0),G[0] ```  returns "[] {}" (no edges)   Expected behaviour: G has edges from node 0 to other nodes.  Comments: out_edges() for other nodes, and in_edges() works.  Possible Fix (not sure if this is ok with sampling): ~~v = 1  # Nodes in graph are from 0,n-1 (this is the second node index).~~ should be "v=0"
