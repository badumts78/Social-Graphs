Bug in intersection?#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  `intersection` with two `Graph`s depends on the order of the nodes in the edges  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen --> The `Graph` class is supposed to be undirected, so the order shouldn't matter.  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ```python import networkx as nx a = nx.Graph([('A', 'B')]) b = nx.Graph([('B', 'A')]) c = nx.Graph([('A', 'B')]) print(nx.intersection(a, b).edges) print(nx.intersection(a, c).edges) ``` returns ``` [] [('B', 'A')] ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.9.13 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
