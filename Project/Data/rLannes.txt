issue
wrong assortativity formula at least in the documentation#TITLE_END#In the documentation at this link for the attribute_assortativity_coefficient function it is stated that the coefficient = trace(M)-sum(M)) / (1-sum(M)) (https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9.1/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.assortativity.attribute_assortativity_coefficient.html#networkx.algorithms.assortativity.attribute_assortativity_coefficient)  This is not True the formula from the reference given: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0209450.pdf) states that the coefficient = trace(M)-sum(M^2)) / (1-sum(M^2))  I tried to check the code but I don't understand it. So may be is just a documentation flaw...
