issue
nx.from_graph6_bytes could (or should) ignore trailing \n bytes (byte code 10)#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  This gives an error:  ``` import networkx as nx nx.from_graph6_bytes(b'>>graph6<<P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{\n') ```  Error is:  `NetworkXError: Expected 136 bits but got 144 in graph6`   <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior  The error happens because of the trailing \n byte (value 10).   I think these trailing bytes can be safely ignored, based on reading this spec: https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt  These could both work the same:  ``` import networkx as nx nx.from_graph6_bytes(b'>>graph6<<P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{\n') nx.from_graph6_bytes(b'>>graph6<<P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{') ```  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> See above  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.12 NetworkX version: 3.3  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
