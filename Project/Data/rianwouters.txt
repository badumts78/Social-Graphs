issue
The weight function cannot use any property of the minimal path up to a certain node#TITLE_END#With reference to https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/16, this is a graph in which weights are depending on the previous node, i.e. the weight of edge (u,v) is determined by how you arrive in (u,v). AFAIKS this can currently not be implemented with the shortest path algorithms, as no information is exposed on the intermediate shortest path to node u. I believe the pred parameter can be used for this, but it is currently not exposed by the public methods.  ### Current Behavior  The weight function cannot be path-dependend  ### Expected Behavior  Information should be available to the weight function (or the pred dictionary should be accessible) so that the weight function can depend on it.  ### Steps to Reproduce  N.A.  ### Environment  N.A.  Python version: NetworkX version:  ### Additional context
