issue
len(G.edges) unexpected values#TITLE_END#I'm not sure if this is a bug or expected behavior but it's at least confusing.  This is using 2.0 nx.Graph() - I would provide the data to recreate, but it's private and I'm not sure why this is occurring, which might just be my lack of knowledge ``` >>> len(G.edges()) 300 >>> G.number_of_edges() 312 >>> count = 0 >>> s = set() >>> for edge in G.edges(): ...     seen = edge in s or (edge[1], edge[0]) in s ...     if not seen: ...         count += 1 ...     s.add(edge) >>> count 312 ``` What would be likely reasons that len() would give a different answer than number_of_edges()?  I thought it was because of reversed edges, but that doesn't seem to be the case either.
