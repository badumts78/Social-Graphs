New Function / Merge -- Network Connectedness#TITLE_END#Hi,  I used the Networkx library to help a marketing professor to analyze social network data. She was interested in the connectedness property of the graph. She listed a R package, however other project related code are written in python. So I hacked my way with a quick implementation using all_pairs_node_connectivity. If it is valuable to networkx project, I can cleanup and make a pull request.  Quote: – Krackhardt’s connectedness for a digraph (directed graph) G is equal to the fraction of all dyads (a group of two nodes), u and v, such that there exists an undirected path from u to v in G  R package in discussion is from here, specifically page 11: http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/samatova/practical-graph-mining-with-R/slides/pdf/Link_Analysis.pdf  Current non-robust implementation:  ```     all_pairs_connectedness = nx.all_pairs_node_connectivity(G)      ## count all pairs with connectivity value > 0     count = 0      for u in all_pairs_connectedness.values():             count+=(sum(x> 0 for x in u.values()))     ## Use 1.0 instead of 1 to force value conversion from int to float.     ## Otherwise integer division will not have decimal portion     connectedness = count / (G.number_of_nodes()*(G.number_of_nodes()-1.0)) ```
