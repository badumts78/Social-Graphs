Graph.remove_node raises NetworkXError while networkx.relabel_nodes raises KeyError#TITLE_END#For starters, thank you for this great package! On to the issue:  As the title says, `Graph.remove_node` raises a `NetworkXError` if the node is not present, while `networkx.relabel_nodes` raises a `KeyError` if a node is present in the `mapping` but not the graph (`G`). This feels inconsistent.  Additionally, the [documentation for remove_node](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.remove_node.html) explicitly mentions a `NetworkXError` will be raised, while the [documentation for relabel_nodes](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.relabel.relabel_nodes.html) does not specify anything related to exceptions (except to say a circular mapping raises an "exception" for in-place relabeling).  Finally, it's worth noting that the [Exceptions documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/exceptions.html) lists a `NodeNotFound` exception that neither `remove_node` nor `relabel_nodes` raises.
