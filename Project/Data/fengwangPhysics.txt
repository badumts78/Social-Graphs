issue
random number seed in connected_watts_strogatz_graph() does not work#TITLE_END#Hello, thanks for the development of networkx.  The `seed` is not updated at each try for generating `connected_watts_strogatz_graph`, so that the same network is generated at each iteration, resulting into an error "Maximum number of tries exceeded" if a user-defined `seed` (not `None`) fails to generate a connected WS graph at the beginning.  The correct implementation might be that ```python     for i in range(tries):         G = watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p, seed)         if not seed is None:             seed += 1         if nx.is_connected(G):             return G     raise nx.NetworkXError('Maximum number of tries exceeded') ```  By the way, it may be useful if the doc of `connected_watts_strogatz_graph` contains the detail about the argument `k` that "Then each node in the ring is joined to its $k$ nearest neighbors (or $k - 1$ neighbors if $k$ is odd)." This sentence is from the "Notes" in `watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p, seed=None)`.
