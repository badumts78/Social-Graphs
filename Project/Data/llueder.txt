issue
jit json import/export#TITLE_END#I would consider the functions `jit_data` and `jit_graph` to be their inverses, so that ``` import networkx as nx nx.jit_graph(nx.jit_data(nx.Graph())) ``` works.  Instead, it produces a TypeError (nx 2.2), because jit_data is a function `nx graph -> json string`, while jit_graph is a function `json object -> nx graph`, so that the correct program would be ``` import networkx as nx import json nx.jit_graph(json.loads(nx.jit_data(nx.Graph()))) ```  This is documented, but in my view unexpected and incoherent behavior. I'm pretty new to networkx and are not familiar with your design philosophy, but see the options * to add a clarifying note in the documentation OR * return the json object in `jit_data` OR * make use of the json.loads function in `jit_graph`.  What are your opinions on this? I am willing to submit a PR (but probably it is just easier for you to make that oneline-commit, so that's also fine :))
