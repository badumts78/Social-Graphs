issue
Shortest_path appear to select routes that are not really the shortest#TITLE_END#I am using the shortest_path api with [NYC's LION Single Line Street Base Map](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-lion.page) to find the shortest distance between two nodes.   I have [cleaned](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeremysze/GIS_exploration/blob/master/code/networkdistance_lion.ipynb) up the file so that non-pedestrians accessible routes are not included.   In this [example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeremysze/GIS_exploration/blob/master/code/networkdistance_lion.ipynb), the shortest_path api worked fine. And so I used this as a template to calculate the shortest_path for a much larger set of nodes.   However, when I was comparing the distances that I've calculated vs. the distance that was calculated by my colleague using ArcGIS, I found large differences in some of the measurements. Even though, we both used the same clean lion line file.   Digging deeper to see why we were getting such huge differences, I found some routes that appeared to be taking a longer route than necessary.   I pulled out a [sample case](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeremysze/GIS_exploration/blob/master/code/networkdistance_lion-issues.ipynb) to illustrate this.   This is my first time using networkx. Perhaps, I could missed something that was absolutely important in order to calculate the network distance correctly. Thank you!
