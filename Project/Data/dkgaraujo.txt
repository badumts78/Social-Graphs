Circular center node layout#TITLE_END#Adds a new layout function based on `circular_layout`. The novel contribution is that the proposed new function `circular_center_node_layout` allows the user to select one node by name or index to be located at the center; all remaining nodes will be homogeneously distributed across the circule (ie, as if the circle had `len(G) - 1` nodes).   This idea occurred to me after I needed to adapt the code of `circular_layout` to create a custom network with a node in the center. I am looking forward to any feedback or opportunity to improve this idea. Please note I have not included any example so far, but would be happy to do so if maintainers think would be helpful.  This pull request passed all tests in my local machine, including the newly added tests. <!-- Please run black to format your code.
