issue
MAINT: updated description of this parameter#TITLE_END#Addresses the documentation issue that I point out #1441, in the case that this functionality is officially supported (though unit tests should also likely be added as well if that's the case, and if they don't already exist). 
issue
is passing nx.draw_networkx_edges width as a list/array of floats supported functionality?#TITLE_END#I'm exploring using networkx in [An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics](www.applied-bioinformatics.org) and I want to display edges where their widths are based on their weights. The `width` option to `draw_networkx_edges` works as I would expect when passed a list of floats, but [the documentation](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/c92f43c40e5a6d1682ae4157ef5255c84ec47f49/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L422) indicates that it only takes a single float.   Is passing a list of floats as `width` to `draw_networkx_edges` officially supported? I want to know if I can rely on that, or if that behavior could change without warning in the future.  Here's an [ipynb illustrating my usecase](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.githubusercontent.com/gregcaporaso/8cc4cf3e347b7158cd06/raw/e28516b8be9608e618708051055158d0734448be/networkx-dna-test.ipynb).  Thanks!
