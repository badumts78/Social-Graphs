nan values in minimum_spanning_tree#TITLE_END#When calculating the minimum_spanning_tree, the algorithm does not correct for (or at least warn about) edges with nan weight.  This can give very strange results, such as a few nodes with very high degree, 'or introduce more subtle bugs.  Simple MWE:  ``` python import networkx, math, random import matplotlib.pyplot as plt G = networkx.complete_graph(100) for n1, n2 in G.edges_iter():     G.edge[n1][n2]['weight'] = random.random()  # Pre-nan f, [ax1, ax2] = plt.subplots(2, 1) ax1.imshow(networkx.to_numpy_matrix(networkx.minimum_spanning_tree(G))!=0) # Post-nan G.add_edge(1, 50, {'weight' : float('nan')}) ax2.imshow(networkx.to_numpy_matrix(networkx.minimum_spanning_tree(G))!=0) plt.show() ```
