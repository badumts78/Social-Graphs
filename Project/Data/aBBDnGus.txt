Travelling Salesman Problem gives wrong results if triangle inequality is not fulfilled#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  Calculating the TSP with a graph that does not fulfill the triangle inequality returns a tour that contains nodes multiple times. Then, the result is not a valid Hamilton cycle.  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  If the triangle inequality is not fulfilled, the method should throw an exception. Further, the fact should be mentioned in the documentation.  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ``` graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_nodes_from(range(2)) graph.add_weighted_edges_from([(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1)]) print(nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem(graph))  # output: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] ``` ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm

Travelling Salesman Problem takes too long for directed graphs#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  Calculating a TSP approximation via `nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem` takes too long for directed graphs. Even for directed graphs with 6 nodes, the procedure takes multiple minutes.  ### Expected Behavior  The solution should be calculated within a few seconds. For directed graphs, the TSP approximation is really fast.  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ``` graph = nx.DiGraph() graph.add_nodes_from(range(6)) graph.add_weighted_edges_from((s, t, s + t) for s in graph.nodes() for t in graph.nodes() if s != t) tour = nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem(graph) ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
