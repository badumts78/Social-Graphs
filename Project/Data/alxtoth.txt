networkx.cycle_basis(g) gets into an infinite loop #TITLE_END#Hi,  Using NetworkX 1.7 with built-in python 2.6 on OS X 10.6.8 / Intel . Same happens with python 2.7 built from HomeBrew.  The edges of my  undirected graph (called g) are :  [('cc', 'cc'), ('cc', 'per'), ('cc', 'cat'), ('cl', 'per'), ('ctr', 'per'), ('per', 'cat'), ('cat', 'cat')]  When calling  networkx.cycle_basis(g) the script gets stuck in infinite loop.  Please note that this happens in rare cases, and in general networkx.cycle_basis(g) works fine on other undirected  graphs with cycles and with edges from- and to- same node.
