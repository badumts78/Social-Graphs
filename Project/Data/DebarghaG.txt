issue
average_clustering() got an unexpected keyword argument 'trials'#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> Hey!  I'm following [this](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/approximation/clustering_coefficient.html#average_clustering) and [this piece of documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.approximation.clustering_coefficient.average_clustering.html#networkx.algorithms.approximation.clustering_coefficient.average_clustering)  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  On running : ```average_clustering(G, trials=1000, seed=None)``` ``` TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-24-7c16ef478e48> in <module> ----> 1 nx.average_clustering(G, trials=1000, seed=None)  TypeError: average_clustering() got an unexpected keyword argument 'trials' ``` However, running : ```average_clustering(G)``` It works as intended.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> average_clustering(G, trials=1000, seed=None) should be valid.  ### Steps to Reproduce Just make a Graph G and call nx.average_clustering(G, trials=1000, seed=None)  ### Environment Python version: 3.8.5 NetworkX version: 2.5.1   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->

Updating average_clustering() documentation - Issue #4734#TITLE_END#Redoing this, because couldn't figure out why a documentation test caused the CI systems to fail last time around.
