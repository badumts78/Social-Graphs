Pydot export fails for nodes with colons in their data.#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  >>> import networkx as nx >>> nx.nx_pydot.write_dot(graph, "/tmp/asdf") Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<console>", line 1, in <module>   File "/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 770, in func     return argmap._lazy_compile(__wrapper)(*args, **kwargs)            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   File "<class 'networkx.utils.decorators.argmap'> compilation 5", line 5, in argmap_write_dot_1     import itertools              ^^^^^^^^   File "/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py", line 51, in write_dot     P = to_pydot(G)         ^^^^^^^^^^^   File "/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py", line 265, in to_pydot     raise ValueError( ValueError: Node names and attributes should not contain ":" unless they are quoted with "".

Please refer https://github.com/pydot/pydot/issues/258 >>>   ### Expected Behavior  A beautiful DOT graph of my networkx graph is exported to /tmp/asdf.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` import networkx as nx import yaml import frozendict  dct = yaml.safe_load(''' name: John age: 30 automobiles: - brand: Honda   type: Odyssey   year: 2018 - brand: Toyota   type: Sienna   year: 2015 ''')  graph = nx.DiGraph() graph.add_node(frozendict.deepfreeze(dct)) nx.nx_pydot.write_dot(graph, "/tmp/asdf") ```  ### Environment  I'm running this on my apple macbook.  Python version: Python 3.11.7 NetworkX version: 3.2.1  ### Additional context  Thank you so much for this incredible tool, which I have found to be extremely valuable for operating on my data.  I have come to get to the point of wanting to draw the diagrams into graphviz or any other, and hit this snag.  I realize that I'm probably not using the library quite as intended; when I found out that node data needed to be hashable I used frozendict to freeze the data rather than just creating a 'proper' python3 object, which by default is hashable. Consequently I have some code now written where I'm using dictionary semantics rather than object semantics, and it will be quite the refactor to fix this problem.  If you do consider the error message, about having a colon in data but no quotes around it, to be a bug in networkx (I can imagine other reasons possibly that we might want to have a colon in node data, unrelated to my being mr. hasty 2024 in his workarounds) then I figured I would let you know about it ahead of refactoring my code in case it makes doing that obsolete.  Thank you so much and again, this is a quite brilliant library, fast, efficient, and a great interface. Thank you.
