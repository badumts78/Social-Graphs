Invalid link weight when contracting#TITLE_END#To solve the "Invalid link weight when contracting" issue, first, identify the two nodes you wish to contract and ensure an edge exists between them. Retrieve the edge weight to confirm it's non-negative, then use a graph library function (like networkx's contracted_nodes) to merge the nodes while preserving their connections. After contraction, validate the resulting edge weights, adjusting any negative values to ensure they are non-negative. Finally, test the contracted graph to confirm the integrity of the weights and connections.
