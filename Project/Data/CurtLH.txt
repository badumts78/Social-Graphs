You can return the nodes in a network with the command `g.nodes` or `g.nodes()`.  The type of object that is returned is called a NodeView.  If you want the results to be returned as a list, you can either `list(g.nodes)` or `list(g.nodes())`.  If you want to save the list containing the nodes, and not just print it to the screen, you can use the command `nodes = list(g.nodes)`.  Refer to the documentation to learn more about [`g.nodes`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.nodes.html)  The bracket command does not work because you cannot slice a NodeView, which is the object that is returned with `g.nodes()`.  However, once you save the nodes as a list with the command mentioned above, you can slices the nodes with `node[:]`.  However, that just returns all the nodes, so I'm not sure what that would accomplish.
