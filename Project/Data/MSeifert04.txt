issue
Add some more files to gitignore related to doc builds and PyCharm#TITLE_END#These files were untracked on my computer, some were created by PyCharm (`.idea`) while others were created during the documentation build.
issue
Fix some examples for python 3 compatibility#TITLE_END#Some of the examples threw errors at me, when I tried to build the documentation locally.  There are still two more failures, one related to `mailbox.UnixMailbox` and one regarding a not-pickable function in `advances/plot_parallel_betweenness`.  I also changed the intersphinx links to `https` to avoid these warnings:  ``` loading intersphinx inventory from http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/objects.inv... intersphinx inventory has moved: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/objects.inv -> https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/objects.inv loading intersphinx inventory from http://docs.python.org/objects.inv... intersphinx inventory has moved: http://docs.python.org/objects.inv -> https://docs.python.org/2/objects.inv ```  Also is there some documentation on how one should build the documentation? It was a bit of trial&error to get that working and I'm not sure I'm building them as "supposed".
issue
Fixes some minor documentation issues (approximation algorithm subpackage)#TITLE_END#This changes some weird formatting in the documentation, mostly in the [`dominating_set` module docstring](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/algorithms.approximation.html#module-networkx.algorithms.approximation.dominating_set). But it also changes two links to Wikipedia that were missing the closing `)` in the link, for example [in `matching`](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/algorithms.approximation.html#graph-matching).
