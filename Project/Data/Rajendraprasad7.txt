Use `minupper` instead of `maxupper` for a tighter Diameter bound in `_extrema_bounding`#TITLE_END#This PR refines the candidate filtering condition in `_extrema_bounding` when computing the diameter of a graph. Previously, the filtering condition was: ``` if ecc_upper[i] <= maxlower and 2 * ecc_lower[i] >= maxupper ``` While using `maxupper` is not incorrect, it provides a looser bound, potentially delaying the removal of certain nodes. Using `minupper` instead ensures a tighter constraint for more efficient pruning: ``` if ecc_upper[i] <= maxlower and 2 * ecc_lower[i] >= minupper ```
