issue
to_pandas_dataframe is not the inverse of from_pandas_dataframe#TITLE_END#The function `from_pandas_dataframe` assumes that the data frame has edge-list like structures, but `to_pandas_dataframe` generates an adjacency matrix.   Personally, I think the edge-list like structures are more useful because: (1) Otherwise these two functions are just (wrapped) duplications of `numpy_matrix` related functions (2) The edge-list like data frames are convenient for other interfaces such as `py2cytoscape`.   Some related commits: [52eb3d3](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/52eb3d38ff78e4002a424ae5e8976998afdaf1a2): `from_pandas_dataframe` and `to_pandas_dataframe` were added. At that time both functions were about adjacency matrix.   [f0c22dd](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/f0c22dd3305ff236860c651d8a08fbabcb8b0a77): `from_pandas_dataframe` was changed to current behavior, but it seems that `to_pandas_dataframe` was forgotten to be changed accordingly.
