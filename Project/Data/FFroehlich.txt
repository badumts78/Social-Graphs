issue
networkx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout fails for graphs with a lot of attribute information#TITLE_END#`graphviz_layout(G, prog='dot')` passes the full graph (including edge and node data) to dot. When (indiviual?) edges or nodes have too much data, dot with fail with an error message like  > syntax error in line 2 scanning a quoted string (missing endquote? longer than 16384?)\nString starting: ...  This error goes away when simply passing a copy of the graph without the edge/node data to graphviz_layout: `graphviz_layout(nx.Graph(G.edges), prog='dot')`. Might be worthwhile to always do that as edge/node data should not affect layout generation, right?
issue
Cannot layout graphs with nodes containing colons#TITLE_END#Example:  ``` import networkx as nx  g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edge('foo:foo', 'foo:bar') print(nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(g)) ```  The problem is a result of two issues: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1568 and https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2050   Essentially, pydot interprets everything after colons as port and shortens names accordingly. I think most of the dot string issues seem to have been resolved in python 3, so I think it might be worthwhile to revisit how this is issue is handled.  In complex graphs, this is an issue that might easily go unnoticed and debugging is all but straightforward.
