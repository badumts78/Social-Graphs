issue
Convergence of spring_layout#TITLE_END#It would be helpful if spring_layout could be configured to terminate before the iteration limit, once the largest value of `delta_pos` is below a specified threshold.
issue
fixing a subset of nodes in spring_layout#TITLE_END#The following layout works reasonably well, ``` import networkx as nx  G = nx.Graph() G.add_edges_from([(0,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,3)]) pos = nx.spring_layout(G) print(pos) ``` However, the results from run to run are not easily reproduced because the initialization is random.    To mitigate this we can fix node 0 to (0,0), as follows, ``` init_pos = {0:(0.0, 0.0)} fixed_pos = [0] pos = nx.spring_layout(G, pos=init_pos, fixed=fixed_pos) print(pos) ``` This results in  the following error, ``` networkx/drawing/layout.py:342: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered ``` A work around seems to be to provide initial points to all positions as follows, ``` import random init_pos = {n:(random.uniform(-1.0, 1.0), random.uniform(-1.0, 1.0)) for n in G} init_pos[0] = (0.0, 0.0) fixed_pos = [0] pos = nx.spring_layout(G, pos=init_pos, fixed=fixed_pos) print(pos) ```
issue
str function for default graphs#TITLE_END#The two print statements below produce the same output which is the empty string.  It would be nice if the later call provided some indication that the graph is non-empty. ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() print(G) G.add_edges_from([(0,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,3)]) print(G) ```
