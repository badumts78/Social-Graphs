Issue with `pydot_layout` function in `networkx` library: AttributeError#TITLE_END#I encountered an issue with the `pydot_layout` function in the `networkx` library. When trying to access the position of a node, an `AttributeError` is raised because the `quote_id_if_necessary` method does not exist in pyrotechnics library.  file:`networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py` rows:`351`   ### Current Behavior  The call to the raises and AttributeError as the code tries to call a method that does not exist anymore. An update is requested.  ### Expected Behavior `graphviz_layout()` and so `pydot_layout()` methods should work.  ### Steps to Reproduce If I develop a code to draw a Sum Product Network like below: ```python def draw_spn(spn):      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt     import networkx as nx     from networkx.drawing.nx_pydot import graphviz_layout      plt.clf()      g, labels = _get_networkx_obj(spn)      pos = graphviz_layout(g, prog="dot")     ax = plt.gca() ... ```` I got the AttributeError: > AttributeError : module 'pydot' has no attribute "'quote_id_if_necessary'"  ### Environment  Conda Environment MacOs system Python version: 3.11.10 NetworkX version: 3.4.2 pydot version:  2.0.0  ### Additional context Suggestion that works: replace row `351` with: `node = Q.get_node(pydot.quote_if_necessary(str_n))`
