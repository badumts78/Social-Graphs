NetworkX not showing the data attributes of nodes#TITLE_END#I am having a trouble as mentioned in the title to this post, and have also made a post up on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43474554/networkx-not-showing-the-data-attributes-of-nodes). Here is the post as it is:  I am having this weird behavior with NetworkX that is not following what would be expected based on the documentation on the Graph object.  Here is my code:  ``` In [22]: G = nx.Graph()  In [23]: G.add_node("Roasted",attr_dict={"css_color":"#454463"})  In [24]: G["Roasted"] Out[24]: {}  In [25]: G.nodes(data=True) Out[25]: [('Roasted', {'css_color': '#454463'})] ``` At `In [23]` I added a node with an attribute dictionary. In `In [24]`, I was simply indexing the graph G like I would on a dictionary and expected it to return `{'css_color':'#454463'}`but I got back an empty dictionary instead. I only get to see that dictionary if I were to call for a printout of the list of nodes with their data displayed.  In the documentation, it showed that:  ``` >>> G.add_node(1, time='5pm') >>> G.add_nodes_from([3], time='2pm') >>> G.node[1] {'time': '5pm'} ``` you should be able to obtain the dictionary simply by indexing on the node name itself. Why did it not work for my case?  EDIT: In case the problem could have been that I used a string instead of an int for the node name, I tried this:  ``` In [29]: G.add_node(1,attr_dict={"css_color":"#454463"})  In [30]: G[1] Out[30]: {} ``` And the problem still persists! Could this be a bug???
