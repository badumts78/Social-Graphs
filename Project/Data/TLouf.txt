perf: optimise `random_k_out_graph`#TITLE_END#I found this generator to be particularly slow, so I dug into it and made several optimizations. The main bottleneck I found was the re-computation of out-degrees at every single step. Updating their values at every step already allowed for a ~20x performance improvement for `nx.random_k_out_graph(1000, 100, 0.1)`. I then introduced numpy to optimize further to reach a ~60x improvement for this same set of parameters (from 2 minutes down to 2 seconds). There are more lines of code but not really more complexity, as most lines are for variable initialisations and updates.
