Add colormap and color limits to LineCollection#TITLE_END#This PR adds the colomap and colomap limits to the LineCollection returned by draw_networkx_edges.  This allows the correct edge colormap to be added to the figure after it's created.  Since graphics are hard to test, here is the code I used to test this out.  ``` import networkx as nx import numpy as np import matplotlib.pylab as plt  G = nx.grid_2d_graph(4, 4)  # 4x4 grid H = G.to_directed() pos = nx.spring_layout(G, iterations=100)  node_values = np.random.rand(H.number_of_nodes())+1 # values between 1 and 2 edge_values = np.random.rand(H.number_of_edges())+2 # values between 2 and 3  plt.figure() ax = plt.gca()  nodes = nx.draw_networkx_nodes(H, pos, nodelist=list(H.nodes()),                                 node_color=node_values,                                vmin=1, vmax=2,                                cmap=plt.cm.winter, ax=ax)  edges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(H, pos, edgelist=list(H.edges()),                                 edge_color=edge_values,                                edge_vmin=2, edge_vmax=3,                                edge_cmap=plt.cm.spring, ax=ax, arrows=False)  plt.colorbar(nodes, pad=0, ax=ax) plt.colorbar(edges, pad=0.05, ax=ax) ``` ![networkx_colorbar_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17935331/67815696-45be7600-fa6d-11e9-8470-309d72ebcfe8.png)  Fixes #3696.    Thanks for creating this great software package!

Within draw_networkx_edges, the LineCollection needs cmap and clim defined before it is returned. Something like this should work.  ``` edge_collection.set_cmap(edge_cmap) edge_collection.set_clim(edge_vmin, edge_vmax) ```

I'm running the same example as @dbhart , and this works as long as the min and max in link_range are not None.  This is handled inside draw_networkx_edges, where vmin and vmax can be defined based on the edge color.  The resulting figure is now matches 2.3.

I can submit a PR (I'm not sure how to test colorbars either)
