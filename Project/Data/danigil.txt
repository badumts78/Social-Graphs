base (ubuntu, pypy-3.8) test fails in PR because of numpy import not in our code#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion --> This is a continuation of a previous issue that was closed: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6377  We added some algorithms that use the existing "minimum_weight_full_matching" function that resides in algorithms/bipartite/matching.py However, the automated tests fail (particularly the one mentioned in the title), because numpy is imported in the aforementioned function. Note: we do not import numpy on our own in our pytest. What's there to do to fix this? I'm reluctant to alter this code since it isn't mine, i'm guessing we're supposed to alter our tests somehow (?) Thanks for the help  PR number: 6374 <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: NetworkX version:  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->

base (ubuntu, pypy-3.8) test fails in PR because of numpy import#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion --> We created a PR for some algorithms we implemented and want to add into the library,   but one of our pytests fails in the "base (ubuntu, pypy-3.8)" automatic test, prompting the following errors:      FAILED networkx/algorithms/bipartite/tests/test_EFM.py::TestMinimumWeightEnvyFreeMatching::test_envy_free_perfect_matching - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy' FAILED networkx/algorithms/bipartite/tests/test_EFM.py::TestMinimumWeightEnvyFreeMatching::test_non_empty_envy_free_matching - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy' <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior importing numpy inside our test raises errors <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior We expect importing numpy to not cause errors since it's one of the packages included in the library's requirements <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment We are both programming in a venv environment, but the problem arises in the automated tests, and not in our systems. <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: latest  ### Additional context To demonstrate the problem, and ensure it isn't a side-effect of something other than the import,   we created another PR which only contains the code that causes the error, indeed, the same problem persists.   click [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6374) to see this PR we created.
