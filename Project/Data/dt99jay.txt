traveling_salesman_problem seems to ignore the weight parameter#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  `traveling_salesman_problem` returns long paths when `weight` is named something other than 'weight'.  ### Expected Behavior  `traveling_salesman_problem` should use the `weight` param to allow the correct edge attribute to be selected.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` import shapely import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Make a 10x10 grid  vert = shapely.geometry.MultiLineString([[(x, 0), (x, 100)] for x in range(0, 110, 10)]) hori = shapely.affinity.rotate(vert, 90) grid = shapely.unary_union([vert, hori])  params = ["weight", "distance"] paths = []  for param in params:      # Turn it into a graph      graph = nx.Graph()     graph.add_edges_from([(*line.coords, {param: line.length}) for line in grid.geoms])          # Select nodes and visit them via TSP          nodes = [(20., 20.), (30., 30.), (20., 80.), (80., 20.), (50., 50.), (60., 10.), (40., 40.), (50., 40.), (50, 30)]          path = nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem(         graph,         weight=param,         nodes=nodes,         cycle=False,         method=nx.approximation.christofides     )          paths.append(shapely.geometry.LineString(path))  print([path.length for path in paths])  ```  > [240.0, 340.0]  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.11 & 3.10.12 NetworkX version: 3.2.1 & 3.4.2  ### Additional context ``` # Plot results  fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5), sharey=True)  for ax, param, path, c in zip(axes, params, paths, ["b", "r"]):     for line in grid.geoms:         ax.plot(*line.xy, c="k", lw=.25)     ax.scatter(*zip(*nodes), c="k")     ax.plot(*path.xy, c=c)     ax.set_title(f"Param={param}, length={path.length}")     ax.set_aspect("equal") ``` ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef5dd219-997a-416f-b934-75ca1e5a5516)

Why does all_shortest_paths find a much shorter route through a weighted graph than shortest_path?#TITLE_END#When I run...  `shortest_path(G, start, end, weight="length")`  ...on a graph (with 2,346 nodes and 13,231 edges, and where `length` is an edge attribute with value of anything between 1 and 5,107) it returns a path of length 9,495.  But when I run...  `all_shortest_paths(G, start, end, weight="length")`  ...for the same `start` and `end` of the same graph, it returns two paths: the one already found in the previous step, but also a shorter one with length 7,940.  Why is the shorter path not returned by `shortest_path` (and why does `all_shortest_paths` include the much longer route at all)?  (My graph is a road network with each node a coordinate in the EPSG:27700 CRS. I'm calculating the length of each route by making a LineString of the nodes produced by `shortest_path` / `all_shortest_paths` and using Shapely to measure the length.)
