issue
Why does the API `all_simple_paths` miss the nodes in a simple CFG?#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  Hi all,  I am currently using `Networkx` API  (`all_simple_paths`) to explore all the simple paths in a CFG of a program, but it seems that this API can not explore all the possible paths in a simple CFG. Could you please check what happened here? Did I use `Networkx`  in an wrong way?  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> Please check the `png` from a `dot` file (attached at the end)  ![test-cfg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19731522/179227716-434f5d17-0297-4529-bd0c-3f8db271a2d5.png)  We can see that the nodes `0x4011ca`  and `4011cf` are in the CFG.  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  The paths explored by `all_simple_paths`:  ``` path :  ['4011a3', '4011b0', '40120e', '401219', '401223', '401228', '40123f', '401244'] path :  ['4011a3', '4011b0', '40120e', '401219', '40123f', '401244'] ```  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  The paths should include the nodes `4011ca` and `4011cf`.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> The script I used to print the paths  ``` import networkx as nx import pygraphviz from networkx.drawing import nx_agraph  G = nx_agraph.from_agraph(pygraphviz.AGraph("./test.dot")) for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source="4011a3", target="401244"):     print("path : ", path) ``` ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8.10 NetworkX version: 2.8.4  ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->  The `dot` file used :  [test.dot.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/9121018/test.dot.zip)   Thanks and look forward to your response!
