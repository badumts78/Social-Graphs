Possible bug in dominance package#TITLE_END#While working with `dominance_frontiers` algorithm I have noticed some strange line of code, which I think leads to incorrect results.  My question is: why try to discard element `u`?  ``` p.discard(u) ```  Given the following example it produces wrong results.  ``` import networkx as nx from networkx.algorithms.dominance import *  g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edges_from([ ('b0','b1'),  ('b1', 'b2'), ('b2', 'b3'), ('b3','b1'),  ('b1','b5'),  ('b5', 'b6'),  ('b5', 'b8'),  ('b6', 'b7'),  ('b8', 'b7'),  ('b7', 'b3'),  ('b3', 'b4') ]  df = dominance_frontiers(g, 'b0')  print df ```  It yields:  ``` {'b0': [],  'b1': [],  'b2': ['b3'],  'b3': ['b1'],  'b4': [],  'b5': ['b3'],  'b6': ['b7'],  'b7': ['b3'],  'b8': ['b7']} ```  However, I expect to see `b1` in `df[b1]`, as if I use general algorithm for `b1`, while parsing its predecessors, `b1` itself will be passed before its immediate dominator `b0`, so it should be added to `df[b1]`. 
issue
Small bug in networkx.algorithms.dominance#TITLE_END#There is a small bug in `networkx.algorithms.dominance` package.   Function `immediate_dominators` should be given digraph and starting point. However, if a given graph has several entry points, say `entry_1` and `entry_2` (e.g. dead code block in control flow graph), and the starting point is specified as `entry_1`, `entry_2` will not be present in `idom` dict (return value) as key. This is correct behavior concerning the definition of dominators, but this can lead to `KeyError` exception in a call to `dominance_frontiers` function, because it does not check predecessors to be reachable from start.  Below is a snippet representing an issue.   ``` import networkx as nx from networkx.algorithms.dominance import *  g = nx.DiGraph()  edges = [             ('entry_1', 'b1'),             ('b1', 'b2'),             ('b2', 'b3'),             ('b3', 'exit'),             ('entry_2', 'b3')         ]  # entry_1 #   | #   b1 #   | #   b2  entry_2 #    |  / #    b3 #    | #   exit  g.add_edges_from(edges)  # will raise KeyError on entry_2 when parsing b3 # because entry_2 does not have immediate doms (no path) dominance_frontiers(g,'entry_1')  ```  Suggestion is to parse only those predecessors that have path from given starting point to them. This can be achieved by adding `v in idom` check which is equivalent to having a path from start point in this context.  P.S. tested on networkx version 1.11
