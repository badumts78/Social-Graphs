issue
`louvain_communities` runs infinite loop#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  The louvain algorithm runs into unending cycle with a specific graph. I test some other graphs (and it ends in few moments) but on this graph (and on a few other graphs) it just runs into infinity.  ### Expected Behavior  The algorithm does not cycle and ends in some time (either raises exception or just some code fixes).  ### Steps to Reproduce The file is provided here: [sth.txt](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/11782239/sth.txt) ``` import networkx as nx graph = nx.read_edgelist(path="sth.txt") nx.algorithms.community.louvain_communities(graph, weight="weight") ```  ### Environment  Python version: 3.9.5 NetworkX version: 3.1 
issue
Generating communities in LFR benchmark runs only `max_iters` times#TITLE_END#<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> Function `_generate_communities` in `networkx.generators` used in `LFR_benchmark_graph` tries to generate communities only `max_iters` times. This is not a behaviour according to [documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.community.LFR_benchmark_graph.html), part `Raises`.  ### Current Behavior User wants to generate LFR graph with `LFR_benchmark_graph`. If user does not specify `max_iters` and chooses number of nodes higher than `500` (which is default value of `max_iters`), then the algorithm never succeeds. The problem is with `_generate_communities`, because it raises `networkx.exception.ExceededMaxIterations`. The number of iterations is less than number of nodes and there is no chance to assign all nodes.  ### Expected Behavior The function should try to generate communities `10 * n * max_iters` times according to documentation, because the algorithm should have a chance to generate communities.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.8.10 NetworkX version: 3.1
