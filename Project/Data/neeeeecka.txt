issue
Where can I get an old version of networkx for python 2.7?#TITLE_END#I need it for personal use, since I'm using a library that has been deprecated few years ago. It used networkx but an old one. Unfortunately I can't find any of old downloads on the pypi.  Could anyone be kind enough to search up old folder of this library on their HDDs and upload it somewhere? I'd be grateful.   Thanks.
