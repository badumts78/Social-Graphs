issue
number_of_edges between two nodes returning incorrect number #TITLE_END#I'm running into a strange issue where `number_of_edges()` doesn't return the actual edges between 2 nodes, but seems to be either returning 0 when there are no edges between and 1 in all other cases even when there are multiple edges between the 2 nodes.  I'm using networkx 1.11  Example code: ``` type(G) > <class 'networkx.classes.multidigraph.MultiDiGraph'> G.in_edges('node1') > [('node2', 'node1')] G.out_edges('node1') > [('node1', 'node2')] G.number_of_edges('node1', 'node2') > 1 ```  Am I doing something wrong/misunderstanding things or is this really not working the way it should?
