issue
GED incredibly slow on small graph#TITLE_END#Hello, I'm trying to calculate the GED  between 2 very small graphs, it's been over 3 hours on a Xeon@3GHz and still it's going on. I managed to get a _slight_ speedup by  hashing all strings to int (just an experiment) but still, at the 3h mark, it's still going on with no end in sight.  Any idea if this is normal or I'm doing something wrong? Attached the 2 graphs and below my very simple code.  `for dist in nx.algorithms.similarity.optimize_graph_edit_distance(G, g, node_match=lambda a,b: a['pr'] == b['pr']):             minD = dist `  Update: after 15h it's still running :(  [Graphs.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/3747132/Graphs.zip)
