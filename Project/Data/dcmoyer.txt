issue
Problems using PyDot, Graphviz, Python 3#TITLE_END#Hello,  My apologies for bothering you, or if this bug was already covered, but I've been using this package for tree plotting.  I am using: -Python 3.3 -Matplotlib -Graphviz (2.32) and -Pydot, the branch found here: https://github.com/nlhepler/pydot  I had to manually fix a byte/string problem in the obj_dict keys, in pydot_layout, line 269 of nx_pydot. It seems that the keys were stored as strings, but the pydot.Node(make_str(n)).get_name().encode('utf-8') line returned a byte. This caused the next 'node[0]' to fail, as the returned list was empty. By omitting the final 'encode' portion, the names produced were accepted.  Thanks, hopefully this isn't a waste of time.
