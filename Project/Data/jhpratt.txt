issue
Status of `graphviz` -- abandoned?#TITLE_END#How is this supposed to work? The documentation is out of date, as the provided examples simply do not work, and don't match the examples (which also don't work) in previous issues.  After thorough searching, this has been around for well over a year (see #1997, #2023, #2128, #2176). Nothing appears to have been worked on regarding this since the first of the issues listed.  I am trying to show a large graph, and any other layout for my purpose needlessly complicates the visual. I fail to understand why nothing has been worked on, but I'm certainly not the only one that is waiting for a solution.
