write_graphml doesn't properly escape characters for XML#TITLE_END#``` >>> import networkx >>> G = networkx.Graph() >>> G.add_node("\\1") >>> import StringIO >>> s = StringIO.StringIO() >>> networkx.write_graphml(G, s) >>> s.getvalue() '<?xml version=\'1.0\' encoding=\'utf-8\'?>\n<graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd">\n  <graph edgedefault="undirected">\n    <node id="\x01" />\n  </graph>\n</graphml>\n' ```  The expected output would instead contain  `<node id="\1" />`. The actual output isn't even valid XML:  ``` >>> from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET >>> ET.fromstring(s.getvalue()) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/xml/etree/ElementTree.py", line 1300, in XML     parser.feed(text)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/xml/etree/ElementTree.py", line 1642, in feed     self._raiseerror(v)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/xml/etree/ElementTree.py", line 1506, in _raiseerror     raise err xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError: not well-formed (invalid token): line 4, column 14  ```  Verified on both 1.11 and git master.

Node names need their special characters escaped for DOT generation (and possibly in other formats)#TITLE_END#Consider the following code:  =========generate.py==============  ``` G = NX.Graph() G.add_node('A\A') NX.write_dot(G, 'graph.dot') ``` #   Running this file results in:  ===========graph.dot==========  ``` strict graph  {         "A\A"; } ``` #   which, when processed with "dot -Tpdf graph.dot > graph.pdf" generates a graph with single node named "AA" instead of "A\A".  The expected output would be:  =============expected.dot=======  ``` strict graph  {         "A\\A"; } ``` #
