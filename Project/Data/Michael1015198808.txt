sping_layout crashs when called#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  The interpreter just crashed when I call networkx.sping_layout with a graph transformed from PyTorch Geometric.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  The interpreter should not crash and return the desired position nodes.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  Run the following code:  ```python3 import networkx as nx  from torch_geometric.utils import to_networkx from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid from torch_geometric.transforms import NormalizeFeatures  dataset = Planetoid('.', 'Cora', transform=NormalizeFeatures())  G = to_networkx(dataset[0], to_undirected=True) pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.1) ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.7.10 NetworkX version: 2.5 PyTorch Geometric version: 1.6.3 PyTorch version: 1.7.1+cu110   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
