issue
is_isomprphic depends on nodes being orderable#TITLE_END#Everything works fine in python 2.7, but not in python3.5 (probably any python3). The reason it works in python 2.7 is because it seems any type is orderable in python2 by default (probably by using their id()), but not in python3  python 2.7  ``` In [1]: class A(object):    ...:     pass    ...:  In [2]: A() < A() Out[2]: False ```  Python 3.5  ``` In [1]: class A:    ...:     pass    ...:  In [2]: A() < A() --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-2-465a92f65f9f> in <module>() ----> 1 A() < A()  ```  I haven't had time understanding how the algorithm works, but the exception is generated here https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/isomorphvf2.py line 539.
