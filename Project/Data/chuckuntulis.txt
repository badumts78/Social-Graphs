issue
Command line interpretor works, but running file with Python fails#TITLE_END#I am trying to generate a simple graph and I keep running into this problem. If I bring up the Windows Power Shell, start python and put the code in line by line, the code executes, the answer is printed out and NO dialog is presented nor is a graph shown  the Demo dialog box pops up when I have not asked for it when I run the the command line  "python ./networkxTestCode.py" and the same thing happens when running the code in Visual Studio Code. The dialog has four lines ... the last of which states "Button that does nothing". If I kill the dialog, the another dialog pops up with an error about PySimpleGUI and starting with a clean unused layout. The code does not import PySimpleGUI.   This last dialog keeps popping up and I have to go to Task Manager to kill it.  This the code from one of the examples in the documentation: " import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph()  G.add_node(1) G.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=4) G.add_edge('B', 'D', weight=2) G.add_edge('A', 'C', weight=3) G.add_edge('C', 'D', weight=4) nx.shortest_path(G, 'A', 'D', weight='weight') " I have used PySimpleGUI successfully with some complex dialogs. Why is it being executed in this case and what do I need to get this code to run.
