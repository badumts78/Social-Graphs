issue
readwrite.cytoscape_graph(data) removes "source" and "target" fields from edges#TITLE_END#Hi,  I realized the function to get a graph from cytoscape data modifies the data that is received as argument. Is there any reason for that? I couldn't find that in the documentation, and I found it when browsing the code.  Thank you in advance!
