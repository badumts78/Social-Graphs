Floyd Warshall algorithm to return all shortest paths between node pairs#TITLE_END#I was interested to propose an additional function for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to return for each node pair in the graph, the predecessor structure which allows to reconstruct all the shortest paths for the given node pair.  This requires a slight modification of `floyd_warshall_predecessor_and_distance` function.  I already have a code change which provides an additional function `floyd_warshall_multi_predecessors_and_distance`. Both `floyd_warshall_multi_predecessors_and_distance` and `floyd_warshall_predecessor_and_distance` re-use the same common function: https://github.com/fsquillace/networkx/commit/b947ffa8cb1f8a032b430f067e916aee2e47e7a5  There is still additional work to do (i.e. unit tests, clean up and better generalization of the function which reconstructs the paths) but if that's a reasonable code change for you, I can continue working on it.  Thank you
