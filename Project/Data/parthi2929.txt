issue
Facilitate direct graphviz output#TITLE_END#Hi  I wanted to extract graphviz out of networkx and draw with neato engine. Currently afaik, networkx exports only to pygraphviz or pydot.   pygraphviz has lot of installation issues (being 64 bit, unable to find and mend with installed graphviz 32-bit files [[1]](https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/issues/132), graphviz not yet released official 64-bit [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4571067/installing-pygraphviz-on-windows?rq=1), etc) Spent whole day trying to solve trying patches here and there which didnt help.  pydot is too limited, that not even able to draw the graphviz without writing down to a file the dot notation and reading via graphviz ``` P = nx.nx_pydot.to_pydot(G) nx.nx_pydot.write_dot(G,'test.dot')                 # write to dot file (graph,) = pydot.graph_from_dot_file('test.dot')    # read to dot file print(graph) ``` This is currently buggy to be used with neato as explained in pydot thread [here](https://github.com/erocarrera/pydot/issues/174#issuecomment-387607404)  Given that, graphviz python API is directly available [here](http://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html), I strongly wish, I was able to export networkx directly to graphviz, and able to draw the diagram without above hassles.  Can you kindly help?
