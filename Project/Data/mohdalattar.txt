Degree Centrality inconsistency #TITLE_END#Hi all,   I am calculating degree centrality (using degree_centrality) for a street network (called from OSMNx package), however, there is inconsistency with the results I am not sure how it can be interpreted.   <img width="696" alt="Screen Shot 2019-10-02 at 10 28 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50058721/66083386-139c2000-e564-11e9-8417-2430ddc2b859.png">  As you can see edge with value of 9 is in fact connected to 6 other edges the same goes for the one with the value 7.   How can you interpret the results
