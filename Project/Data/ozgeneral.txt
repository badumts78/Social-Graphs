issue
communicability_centrality does not exist#TITLE_END#I am using version 2.1 on python 3 and networkx works perfectly fine except that I cannot find the function communicability_centrality which is [mentioned](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.communicability_centrality.html#networkx.algorithms.centrality.communicability_centrality) in documentation. Is it removed from networkx and documentation is not updated or is there a way to use this function?  Note: /home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/networkx/ does not have a file called communicability_centrality
