No warning/error message when from_dict_of_lists is passed a dictionary with string type keys#TITLE_END#**Version**: networkx (1.11)  We were using the following code to generate the adjacency matrix from a dictionary representation ``` dict={0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3]} #some graph nx.adjacency_matrix(nx.from_dict_of_lists(dict)) ``` We found out that on some places the adjacency matrix generated was wrong and after hours of digging ... we figured out that somewhere in the process the dictionary was json encode/decoded which resulted in a dictionary with string typed keys . `dict={"0": [1], "1": [2], "2": [3]}` which changes the output of `nx.from_dict_of_lists`. I don't know networkx library that well but if it is intended behavior it should be explained in the [docs](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/networkx.convert.from_dict_of_lists.html?). or maybe should log a warning message.  Now you can just say we should have been more careful but I think it is an easy enough mistake to make. Hope this helps someone  **TLDR**; when dictionary keys are strings it results in a different graph, which can effect other operations ``` import networkx as nx  test_string={"0": [1], "1": [2], "2": [3]} wrong=nx.adjacency_matrix(nx.from_dict_of_lists(test_string)) test_int={0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3]} true=nx.adjacency_matrix(nx.from_dict_of_lists(test_int)) print(wrong) print(true) ```
