attribute assortativity returns nan#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  attribute assortativity returns `nan` when there is only a single value of the attribute for all nodes   ### Current Behavior ``` >>> G = nx.DiGraph() >>> G.add_edges_from([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0)]) >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G,'x','C') >>> nx.attribute_assortativity_coefficient(G,'C') nan ``` ### Expected Behavior ``` >>> G = nx.DiGraph() >>> G.add_edges_from([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0)]) >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G,'x','C') >>> nx.attribute_assortativity_coefficient(G,'C') 1.0 ```  The problem is in `algorithms/assortativity/correlation.py` at `attribute_ac` line `255`   ```     r = (t - s) / (1 - s)     ``` `s=1` when there is only a single value of the attribute.

restructured networksimplex.py and added test_networksimplex.py#TITLE_END#Restructured `networksimplex.py` and added a class to handle the internal function and essential data, and for testing added `test_networksimplex.py` with few new test cases taken from [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/flow/mincostflow) ( do check out google colab notebook option to run on an example )  Closes #4660

Hi @dschult, this seems interesting, so may I take it up? On top of that, when I was going through the repo, I found that on doing a quick search for `TODO` it's not very clear why the algorithm is not implemented for certain types of graphs. Eg.  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/27127bc95b773c6a68c0cebc19b10bdb03f48d2c/networkx/algorithms/clique.py#L296 https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/27127bc95b773c6a68c0cebc19b10bdb03f48d2c/networkx/algorithms/distance_regular.py#L181 https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/27127bc95b773c6a68c0cebc19b10bdb03f48d2c/networkx/algorithms/approximation/dominating_set.py#L21  I was wondering if it would be helpful to have a message/text/doc or some references, telling more about why it is not implemented for certain types of graphs?
