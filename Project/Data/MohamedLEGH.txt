Error writting stochastic_block_model as a gml file : networkx.exception.NetworkXError: {0} is not a string#TITLE_END#Hello, I was working with stochastic block model and I tried to write my model into a gml file but it raised an exception. It seems that the attributes of the graph created when building a SBM are not compatible with GML.  ### Current Behavior ```bash Error when writing the GML :    File "/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 788, in func     return argmap._lazy_compile(__wrapper)(*args, **kwargs)            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   File "<class 'networkx.utils.decorators.argmap'> compilation 10", line 5, in argmap_write_gml_6     import itertools              ^^^^^^^   File "/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 878, in write_gml     for line in generate_gml(G, stringizer):                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   File "/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 786, in generate_gml     yield from stringize(attr, value, ignored_keys, "  ")   File "/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 763, in stringize     yield from stringize(key, val, (), indent, True)   File "/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 773, in stringize     raise NetworkXError(f"{value!r} is not a string") networkx.exception.NetworkXError: {0} is not a string ``` ### Expected Behavior Create a gml file of the graph  ### Steps to Reproduce Here is the code that I used to have the bug: ```python import networkx as nx  sizes = [1, 10] probs = [[0, 1.0], [1.0, 0]] G = nx.stochastic_block_model(sizes, probs)  nx.write_gml(G, "test.gml") ```  ### Environment  Python version:  3.13.1 NetworkX version: 3.4.2  ### Additional context I suppose I should convert the attributes into string but I don't know if I need to do it manually or if there is an option to do it when building the graph
