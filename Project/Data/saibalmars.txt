modularity fail with input community as generator #TITLE_END#Hi all, I tried to compute the modularity with build-in community detection algorithm, and figure out that the `is_partition` check of modularity make it fail if the input is a generator of a community.  Basically when modularity called, it feeds the `community` into `is_partition` to check if the given `community` is a valid one, then compute the modularity. However, if you feeds the default output of every current community detection algorithm, which is a generator of `community`, this generator is modified by `is_partition` and cause the follow up computation to fail.   A quick and dirty fix Is always convert the `community` into a list, or make a copy of generator when `is_partition` is called,  but it seems to against the idea of using generator in 2.0.  Is there any better idea for that? Or at least mentioned that in the document?  Thanks all!  Here is some sample failing code: ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.karate_club_graph() community = nx.algorithms.community.label_propagation_communities(G) modularity = nx.algorithms.community.modularity(G,community) ```  Error message: ``` --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NotAPartition                             Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-4-a4ef4ed5d1fb> in <module>() ----> 1 modularity = nx.algorithms.community.modularity(G,community)  /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/community/quality.py in modularity(G, communities, weight)     293     """     294     if not is_partition(G, communities): --> 295         raise NotAPartition(G, communities)     296     297     multigraph = G.is_multigraph()  NotAPartition: Zachary's Karate Club is not a valid partition of the graph <generator object label_propagation_communities at 0x11c1cfc78> ```

Add Approximation for edge_betweenness_centrality as wishlist in #1220#TITLE_END#Hi all, I'm new here, so apologize if I did anything stupid, I just happened to need this function, and figured out this is in the wishlist #1220, so I mimic the approximation method in betweenness_centrality to add approximation for edge betweenness centrality. Hope this is the correct way to contribute to network :)
