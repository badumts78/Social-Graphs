issue
Bugfix for issue 5123#TITLE_END#`multipartite_layout()` was failing on graphs containing nodes with non-numeric partition labels because node coordinates were being created using the partition labels. Changed loop to use `enumerate()` so that node coordinates are generated from the index of the partition, not its label (per @LelioC 's fix [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5123)).    I added test for nodes w/ non-numeric partition labels and non-numeric names to `test_multipartite_layout()`.  Closes #5123
comment
I made the change suggested by @LelioC and added non-numeric partition label test to `test_multipartite_layout()`. Node coordinates (i.e. `xs` and `ys`) were being generated using the partition labels thus non-numeric labels produced non-numeric coordinates. Using @LelioC's change, the coordinates are now created using the index of the label in `layers`.  This is my first contribution to the project so I appreciate any feedback if I'm doing something wrong.
