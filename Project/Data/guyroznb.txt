group with high betweenness centrality#TITLE_END#hi, I recently uploaded a PR #4435 improving the runtime of the group betweenness centrality using the algorithm in [1]. The authors presented in [2] two algorithms which find group of vertices with high GBC. One using heuristic search and approximated one using greedy algorithm. Both of which are based on the same basic idea as in [1].  The algorithms performed better on scale-free networks: heuristic search was faster and the greedy algorithm produced more accurate results.  The running time of the heuristic algorithm is `O(n^k)` and the running time of the greedy algorithm is `O(n^3)`.  Does finding group with high GBC has any use in networkx. And if so, which algorithm should I implemented?

adding weight description to centrality metrices#TITLE_END#Hi, This PR answers the issue #3921 adding description to the weight in each centrality metric.  Some of the centralities use weight as strength (such as eigenvector centrality) and some uses weight as length (such as betweenness centrality). thanks.

improve group betweenness centrality#TITLE_END#In this PR I improved the group betweenness centrality algorithm by using the algorithm of Puzis et al. "Fast algorithm for successive computation of group betweenness centrality".  In the previous implementation of the algorithm, for each pair of source - target non - group nodes permutation, all the shortest paths were found and if one of them go through one of the nodes in the group then the group betweenness centrality increases. This was done for each group.  Here I used Pusiz et al. implementation, which finds the GBC with running time of $O(K^3)$ for each group (k is the number of nodes in the group) and with a preprocessing time of $O(mn)$ for all the groups.  This unable us to find the GBC of many groups in one preprocessing step. Furthermore, the article shows how to find the prominent group of size k (the group with the highest GBC among those with size k), which I would add in future PR.
