Restricted turns for a MultiDiGraph#TITLE_END#Hi, I trying to implement a MultiDiGraph street route network based on [HERE ](https://here.com/en/products-services/data/here-map-data) data (taking inspiration from the [OSMNX](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) project.   I was wandering how I should implement the restricted turns for a car network. Is there a way to implement a solution not using the `weight` attribute (as suggested in [this post])(https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/16453/how-to-restrict-or-block-certain-paths-in-networkx-graphs)?  Any directions would be appreciated.  Sephi
