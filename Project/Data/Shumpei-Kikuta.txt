draw_networkx_nodes: Error doesn't show my mistakes exactly.#TITLE_END#Hi,   I passed nodelist to draw_networkx_nodes method as it needs. But if I set nodelist as ndarray in numpy, it shows the following error.  ``` ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all() ```  The nodelist I passed is like as follows.  ``` a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5)] nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos=pos, nodelist=a) ``` I'm sure G has each node in a, and pos is exactly what it needs.  I managed to solve this problem by transforming ndarray to list like this.  ``` a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5)] nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos=pos, nodelist=a.tolist()) ```  I believe that error confuses us, so we should either allow to pass ndarray or show a more accurate error.  Thank you for your consideration.

Try to bug Fix #3552#TITLE_END#Solve the error as https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3552 , which allows us to use numpy ndarray. Thank you for your time to check my work.
