Fix minimum_cut partition errors with floating-point capacities#TITLE_END#Fixes #4972. Fixes #4592.  When using floating-point capacities, the partition returned by `minimum_cut` may be incorrect due to floating-point precision errors.  Example: ```python import networkx as nx w = 0.1 G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edge("a", "b", capacity=1) G.add_edge("b", "a", capacity=w) G.add_edge("a", "c", capacity=2) G.add_edge("s", "a", capacity=2) G.add_edge("s", "b", capacity=2) G.add_edge("a", "t", capacity=1) G.add_edge("b", "t", capacity=1) G.add_edge("c", "t", capacity=2) print(nx.minimum_cut(G, "s", "t")) ```  On this graph, `nx.minimum_cut(G, "s", "t")` returns `(3.1, ({'s'}, {'a', 'b', 'c', 't'}))`, but the cost of this returned partition is 4 and the correct return value should be `(3.1, ({'b', 's'}, {'a', 'c', 't'}))`.  I have resolved this issue by replacing the strict equality check with one that can handle floating-point rounding errors.  I have also included this example graph as a test instance and added a small tolerance for the tests to avoid errors when using floating-point capacities.
