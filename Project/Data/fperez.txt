Add .mailmap file to consilidate contributors.#TITLE_END#I may have missed a few but I tried to catch all the ones for committers with a fair amount of activity, as well as some obvious ones for single commits each with a different address.  The file can be later updated if anyone notices any I missed.
issue
Add mailmap file for correct git shortlog stats.#TITLE_END#This will ensure that stats created with `git shortlog -sn` correctly aggregate commits even if the raw log has different names for some developers.

Very happy to see you guys using our tools!  Let us know if anything needs clarification, and conversely, please send any upates/improvements our way :)

Other projects, such as @sympy https://github.com/sympyhave the > sympy-bot https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot for testing pull  I completely agree.  I think it's OK to beat the tools up a little ourselves in each project until the dust settles, and then we should make it a standalone toolset that we can all pull in via git submodules.  That will let us all work as if it were builtin, while reusing each other's improvements more easily, and making it simpler for others to adopt these tools and practices.  > Thanks for test_pr.py and friends @ipython https://github.com/ipythonguys! >  > Our pleasure!

If we're still using the 'upstream' language, we need to fix that.  That was the original setup we came up with at the very beginning, but we've fine-tuned it a bit and now we follow more standard conventions (using 'origin' for the main repo) that make it easier to copy/paste all default messages and instructions github generates.  I'm not using the name 'upsteream' anywhere anymore.  Sorry if our outdated docs led you astray...

By name: I now refer to 'origin' for all projects' main repos, and use 'fperez' to refer to my own.  That way it's fully consistent always: named repos are people's (my own or from other developers) and 'origin' always means official project.  That approach has the advantage that copy/pasting snippets that github auto-generates on pull requests and similar almost always works, as they tend to refer to origin for everything.  I think the numpy instructions were created back when we thought of the 'upstream'  naming model, and they may not have been updated.  It seemed like a good idea at the time, but in practice we found it was better to fine-tune it a little.  I've been now using the origin/personal names pattern for quite a while and find it 100% satisfactory.
