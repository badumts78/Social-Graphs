Adding tree broadcasting algorithm in a new module.#TITLE_END#Hello NetworkX developers,  I have implemented a first algorithm for the broadcasting module. You can find an initial proposal and discussion about this [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/6824).  This algorithm retrieves the optimal broadcast time of a tree.  I decided to include it in ``approximation and heuristics``since my teammate and I are planning to add more algorithms which won't necessarily be optimal. (Broadcasting from an arbitrary graph and random originator is NP-complete after-all)  I tried to follow general good practices by including docstrings, references and I hope the code itself is also efficient enough.  Please provide feedback or let me know if you need clarifications on the algorithm itself.

New graph generator for the Kneser graph#TITLE_END#This PR implements a new graph generator, namely the kneser graph with parameters ``n`` and ``k``. The implementation is adapted from the same generator in sageMath, see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/272582be9e0ddbf253a5dfbcd772f53c51fcf700/src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py#L78) for the referenced source code.  I also used [this](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/KneserGraph.html) resource from Wolfram to understand some properties of the kneser graphs. I have added some corresponding tests and I also reformatted some generators so that they would all be in alphabetic order.   P.S I also wasn't sure if I should include the ``create_using`` parameter and also the ``nx.dispatch`` which I think comes from the graphBLAS backend? Please let me know if any of these two additions would be necessary and I can make the changes accordingly.

updating TSP example docs#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> Hello, I just found a small typo in the example docs for the traveling salesman problem. I was also wondering what's the best way to add a hyperlink for christofides with this link:(https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.approximation.traveling_salesman.christofides.html#christofides), does sphinx docs support markdown in the python comments? and is there a shortcut for the link?
