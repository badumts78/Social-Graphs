Subgraph isomorphisms generator generates a non-isomorphic mapping#TITLE_END#The generator `subgraph_isomorphisms_iter` generates a mapping that is not a subgraph isomorphism on the directed graphs `G1 = DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2)])` and `G2 = DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2)])`. More precisely, it generates the mapping `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}` from G1 to G2 that maps  - the G1 edge `(1, 2)` to G2 non-edge `(1, 2)` and - G1 non-edge `(0, 2)` to the G2 edge `(0, 2)`.  The following code emits a warning for each "edge mismatch" in each isomorphism:  ``` import itertools import warnings  import networkx as nx from networkx.algorithms.isomorphism import GraphMatcher  G1 = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2)]) G2 = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2)]) for m in GraphMatcher(G1, G2).subgraph_isomorphisms_iter():     for e1 in itertools.product(m.keys(), repeat=2):         e2 = tuple(m[n] for n in e1)         if e1 in G1.edges and e2 not in G2.edges:             warnings.warn(f'Mapping {m} is not a subgraph isomorphism. The edge {e1} is present in G1 but its image {e2} is absent in G2.')         if e1 not in G1.edges and e2 in G2.edges:             warnings.warn(f'Mapping {m} is not a subgraph isomorphism. The edge {e1} is absent in G1 but its image {e2} is present in G2.') ```  Definition of "subgraph" and "graph-subgraph isomorphism": https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/isomorphism.vf2.html  NetworkX version: 2.4
