issue
Node still exist after removing using remove_node#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  I have a graph file, and I read it using `nx.read_gexf`, Then, I try to find nodes whose degree bigger than 2. I try to explode these nodes. For a node, $N$, whose degree is $d$, I created $d$ new nodes, connected the created new nodes to the neighbored nodes of $N$, and then deleted the node $N$. I have implemeted this. However, I found that the node $N$ still exist after I remove it using `nx.Graph.remove_node`. I have checked this using `graph.has_node(N)`, the result is `True`. During debugg, I also found that the attributes of the node $N$ become empty `{}`. I also put the `remove_node` in `try` sentence, but No error was raised.  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior sucessfully remove the node, or raise a warning.   <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  The code I used is as follows: ```python  import os import sys  import numpy as np  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import networkx as nx   def test(graph, dst):     G = graph.copy()     deg = G.degree()      # explode     multi_br_nodes = []     for nid in G.nodes(data=False):         if deg[nid]>2:             multi_br_nodes.append(nid)      print('-------------------------------------')     print(graph.nodes['P1020914_23502'])          relabel_mapping = {}     for node in multi_br_nodes:          node_attr = graph.nodes[node].copy()          edges = G.edges(node)         i = 0         for _, eid in edges:             # add exploded edges             graph.add_node(f'{node}_{i}_exploded', **node_attr)             graph.add_edge(eid, f'{node}_{i}_exploded')             relabel_mapping.update({f'{node}_{i}_exploded': f'{node}'})             i += 1                  # delte the node         try:             graph.remove_node(node)         except:             print(f'remove node {node} failed')      print('P1020914_23502' in multi_br_nodes)     print(graph.has_node('P1020914_23502'))     print(graph.nodes['P1020914_23502'])      if __name__ == "__main__":     pth = '/home/nobug/Docs/'     G0 = nx.read_gexf(pth+'merged.gexf', node_type=str, relabel=False)      sampled_G = test(G0, dst=0.02)      print('over!!!')  ```  I also upload the graph file in google drive, you can download it. Link: > https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Bu0zOhOnR4gYu-PVsjuhWZ7IfaCvY2R/view?usp=sharing  The result is as follows:  ![de4aaa623da977ca38fa19fbdbe38ec](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/28522692/57f5cd8d-c58d-48f3-a074-836583274748)  As you can see, the node` 'P1020914_23502'` is in variable `multi_br_nodes`. After removing it in `for node in multi_br_nodes:`, the graph still have this node.    <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Ubuntu: 20.04 Python version: 3.10.8 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  Thank you for your help if anyone can give me some ideas to solve it.  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
