Update geometric networks with new models#TITLE_END#Contribution to add the Soft Random Geometric Graphs model by Penrose [1] and Thresholded Random Geometric Graphs to the geometric.py network generator module. Generator function is called "soft_random_geometric_graph" and "thresholded_random_geometric_graph".  Some notes: 1. I had to refactor the _fast and _slow__construct_edges functions to return a list of edges instead of directly adding the edges to the graph within those functions so that other models can take advantage of the KDTree implementation. These functions are now called _fast_edges/slow_edges and return a list of possible edge node pairs without adding them to the network. The edge addition is now done internal to the network model (ie. within the random_geometric_graph function) 2. I've implemented the model so an arbitrary probability density function, called p_dist, can be supplied for the connection probability as a function of distance parameter. This allows users to use arbitrary pdfs, for example from scipy.stats library of implemented distributions, and you can pass the .pdf method as the p_dist parameter. The variable name p_dist seems ok to me, but we can change it if there's something better. Also, it would be nice if we can refactor the other models that have a similar probability parameter (ie. waxman and geometric_threshold_graphs) to be able accept the same arbitrary pdfs for expansibility and consistency of the models, but I haven't implemented that here.  3. I don't think the ReadTheDocs is updated correctly for my code, I think I'm missing something here for how to properly build the docs with the new generator model. **Edit: Figured it out, working now**  Left TODO: 1. Testing - I haven't written any tests yet for the new model. **Edit: Tests Added** 2. Check Documentation - check how to get this working for new model **Edit: Got it, working now** 3. Arbitrary pdf for waxman and GTG model - I'll wait for your review of the proof of concept implemented in the SRGG model. **Edit: Ok, I went ahead and did this for the GTG model. I've kept the alpha parameter for backwards compatibility, but provided the ability to input a custom probability distribution.**  4. Implement another new geometric model - Thresholded Random Geometric Graphs. **Edit: Implemented** 5. Jupyter notebook tutorial highlight different uses for geometric models. **Edit See [PR 6](https://github.com/networkx/notebooks/pull/6) in the notebooks repo.**  Last note, this is my first pull request ever, sorry in advance for any hiccups!
