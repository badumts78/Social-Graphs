calculating numeric assortativity requires int?#TITLE_END#I am trying to use networkx to calculate numeric assortativity based on a numeric attribute that I set to nodes. My node attributes are floats. When I call the assortativity function:  `assort = nx.numeric_assortativity_coefficient(G,'float_attr')`  I got the following errors.  ``` File "/some dir.../networkx/algorithms/assortativity/correlation.py", line 229, in numeric_assortativity_coefficient a = numeric_mixing_matrix(G,attribute,nodes) File "/some dir.../networkx/algorithms/assortativity/mixing.py", line 193, in numeric_mixing_matrix mapping=dict(zip(range(m+1),range(m+1))) TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got float. ```  I checked the documentation page of networkx assortativity algorithm and it did not say the numeric attributes have to be int. Anyone knows if that's required?  BTW, I used the same network and a gender attribute (set to 0 and 1) to calculate both the attribute and the numeric assortativity. I had no problem with that. So it seems that the problem is with the int/float type of the node attribute. However, a lot of numeric node attributes are in fact continuous variables, which are best represented using float instead of int data type.  I would suggest either 1) make it clear in the documentation that the node attribute to calculate numeric assortativity requires int. or 2) make changes to the code so that it can deal with float type of node attributes.
