issue
fix `optimize_edit_paths` handling of self-loops#TITLE_END#My first ever contribution to an open source project !  bugfix for : nx.graph_edit_distance returns wrong value when one graph contains only one node and loops and the other graph is empty #8188  I added the previously failing tests to the test suite.  The fix was to only attempt to match edges after one node match has been made but only if it's possible that a substitution even exists.  This "only if it's possible that a substitution even exists" was what was missing before.  To check if a substitution is possible, there has to be at least one pending edge in both g and h.
