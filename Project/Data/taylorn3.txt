Write_graphml doesn't work on contracted graphs#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> I cannot write a graph that has been contracted to a graphml file.  ### Current Behavior I receive the following error: ``` ~/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py in write_graphml_lxml(G, path, encoding, prettyprint, infer_numeric_types, named_key_ids, edge_id_from_attribute)     169         )     170  --> 171     writer = GraphMLWriterLxml(     172         path,     173         graph=G,  ~/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py in __init__(self, path, graph, encoding, prettyprint, infer_numeric_types, named_key_ids, edge_id_from_attribute)     727      728         if graph is not None: --> 729             self.add_graph_element(graph)     730      731     def add_graph_element(self, G):  ~/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py in add_graph_element(self, G)     768         for node, d in G.nodes(data=True):     769             for k, v in d.items(): --> 770                 T = self.xml_type[self.attr_type(k, "node", v)]     771                 self.get_key(str(k), T, "node", node_default.get(k))     772         # Edges and data  KeyError: <class 'dict'> ```  ### Expected Behavior The graph should be exported to test.graphml  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` import networkx as nx G=nx.Graph() G.add_edge("A","B") G=nx.contracted_edge(G,["A","B"]) nx.write_graphml(G,"test.graphml") ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9.5 NetworkX version: 2.6.3   ### Additional context It appears the issue is that NetworkX writes contractions as attributes of the node, but then the writer doesn't know how to handle dict attributes.
