Community detection algorithms#TITLE_END#Hi,  Just wonder if there is any community detection algorithms such as Louvain algorithm and Infomap algorithm.  If there is no merged version for them, I can implement them.  Thanks

Installation Error on OSX EI Capitan#TITLE_END#Hello,  When I installed networkx using "sudo pip install networkx", it always has the following error in the last.  Although I can still import networkx, just would like to figure it out.  Thanks  Command "/usr/bin/python -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/private/tmp/pip-build-Zp_QXW/networkx/setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-GeskfW-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in /private/tmp/pip-build-Zp_QXW/networkx/

I have a question that why we need separate classes for sparse graph and dense graph. If we use matrix for sparse graph and dense graph, we have the same space complexity for both class, and linear algebra graph algorithms for both graphs have the same time complexity (but actually maybe dense graph can have higher performance because it can take advantage of bandwidth or cache). For example, we also can use csgraph BFS for dense graph even though it is for sparse graph, right?

@MridulS Thanks for your answering. Of course we can store sparse graph in compressed. If we only store nonzero entries of sparse matrix, like CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format, is it still called matrix? Because we only need three arrays for storage(val, row_pointer and column index). Besides, based on this, how can we do a linear algebra graph algorithm with CSR format? Or we just implement graph algorithm based on CSR format for sparse matrix, not a linear algebra graph for sparse graph?
