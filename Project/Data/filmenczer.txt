Fixes bug in networkx.algorithms.community.label_propagation.asyn_lpa_communities#TITLE_END#The old convergence test was inconsistent with the reference paper. It would stop only if each node has a single majority label among its neighbors. In a network like below, the bridge node will always have `best_labels` = 2 and the stopping condition will never be met.  ![ex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10651090/63064936-d86d6100-bed1-11e9-88d4-2040024a4829.jpg)  This prevented convergence in many cases, including the karate_club_graph.   Instead, according to the cited reference, a node should be satisfied if it has a majority label (either blue or red in the above example), even if there are multiple tied majority labels (two in the case above).  The algorithm is now consistent with the cited reference and is guaranteed to converge.
