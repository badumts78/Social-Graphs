RuntimeWarning: networkx backend defined more than once for networkx v3.2+ on RHEL 9.2 OS#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  This isn't specifically a "bug" in that anything is broken, but more a curiosity (to me) that a RuntimeWarning seems to be OS dependent. For installation in RHEL 9.2 releases I'm seeing  ```pytb RuntimeWarning: networkx backend defined more than once: nx-loopback   backends.update(_get_backends("networkx.backends")) ```  but this isn't present on other OS versions. I'm not sure why.  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  To get a REHL 9.2 environment (which is what the cluster I'm on has) we can use Docker or podman and RedHat's container registries   ```console $ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:9.2-755.1697625012 $ docker run --rm -ti registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:9.2-755.1697625012 [root@6c881a6cd600 /]# cat /etc/os-release  NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" VERSION="9.2 (Plow)" ID="rhel" ID_LIKE="fedora" VERSION_ID="9.2" PLATFORM_ID="platform:el9" PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 (Plow)" ANSI_COLOR="0;31" LOGO="fedora-logo-icon" CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9::baseos" HOME_URL="https://www.redhat.com/" DOCUMENTATION_URL="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9" BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/"  REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9" REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=9.2 REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="9.2" [root@6c881a6cd600 /]# python3 --version Python 3.9.16 [root@6c881a6cd600 /]# dnf install -y python3-pip [root@6c881a6cd600 /]# python3 -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate && python3 -m pip --quiet install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel (venv) [root@6c881a6cd600 /]# python -m pip --quiet install --upgrade 'networkx<3.2.1' && python -m pip freeze | grep networkx && python -c 'import networkx' networkx==3.2 /venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/utils/backends.py:135: RuntimeWarning: networkx backend defined more than once: nx-loopback   backends.update(_get_backends("networkx.backends") (venv) [root@6c881a6cd600 /]# python -m pip --quiet install --upgrade 'networkx<3.2' && python -m pip freeze | grep networkx && python -c 'import networkx' networkx==3.1 (venv) [root@6c881a6cd600 /]#  ```  I don't really understand why this   ```pytb RuntimeWarning: networkx backend defined more than once: nx-loopback   backends.update(_get_backends("networkx.backends") ```  pops up for `networkx` `v3.2+`. This doesn't happen in a Debian based container:  ```console $ docker run --rm -ti python:3.9 /bin/bash root@5eb063d4ac32:/# python -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate (venv) root@5eb063d4ac32:/# python3 -m pip --quiet install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel (venv) root@5eb063d4ac32:/# python -m pip --quiet install --upgrade 'networkx<3.2.1' && python -m pip freeze | grep networkx && python -c 'import networkx' networkx==3.2 (venv) root@5eb063d4ac32:/# ```  ### Expected Behavior  No `RuntimeWarning` is raised.  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ```console $ docker run --rm -ti registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:9.2-755.1697625012 # dnf install -y python3-pip # python3 -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate && python3 -m pip --quiet install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel # python -m pip --quiet install --upgrade 'networkx<3.2.1' && python -m pip freeze | grep networkx && python -c 'import networkx' ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: Python 3.9.16 NetworkX version: 3.2+  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->

CI: Update scientific-python/upload-nightly-action from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0#TITLE_END#* Update the scientific-python/upload-nightly-action to v0.4.0 to avoid issues with uploading wheels of the same name to Anaconda Cloud where the project being uploaded to only contains one wheel (the one being replaced).    - c.f. https://github.com/scientific-python/upload-nightly-action/releases/tag/0.4.0  I know that Dependabot manages the GitHub Actions updates, but this release was made specifically to try to fix the issues that `networkx` has been having  <img width="1649" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-21 at 10 27 39 PM" src="https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/5142394/bc9ca745-9f2e-40f9-af26-efe5956f2026">  so I wanted to try to fix this rather than waiting a month.

CI: Pin scientific-python/upload-nightly-action to 0.2.0#TITLE_END### PR Summary  The [`scientific-python/upload-nightly-action`](https://github.com/scientific-python/upload-nightly-action/) action has received stability updates in [`0.2.0`](https://github.com/scientific-python/upload-nightly-action/releases/tag/0.2.0) that provide a reproducible runtime environment for the action, which should mitigate issues with stability.  Using stable known releases provides additional protection from service disruption incidents (like https://github.com/scientific-python/upload-nightly-action/issues/43). Future releases will get picked up automatically by Dependabot  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/364e20eca8f270b9d364fab7f73ea63338790d98/.github/dependabot.yml#L2-L8
