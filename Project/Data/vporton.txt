Should document the behavior for zero-weight edges#TITLE_END#How do "shortest path" family of functions behave on weighted graphs some of whose nodes have `weight=0`? It should be documented (now it isn't!) at https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html  I will describe the actual problem I am facing:  I have a set of "transformations" whose source and destination are finite sets of URLs.  A "chain" of transformations is a finite sequence `s_0 ... s_n` where `Dst s_i <= Src s_{i+1}` (`<=` denotes "is subset of"). I need to find shortest chain(s) of transformations with given source and destination of the chain.  My proposed solution is to add to the multidigraph of transformations nodes `(i, j, weight=0)` for every `i <= j` (may be a little inefficient but OK for the first version of my software). After the search is done, I remove nodes of this form.  Then I can reconstruct sequences `s_0 ... s_n` of transformations.  So, I face the question: May `networkx` ("stupidly" by human mind measure) add zero-weight nodes where they are non-necessary?

Shortest path from any of multiple destinations#TITLE_END#I need to find the set of shortest paths from any of s1, ..., sN to d.  I think, it would be good to have direct support for this (multiple sources and/or destinations while searching for a shortest path) in NX.

Missing in Multi[Di]Graph docs#TITLE_END#Please add to https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/multidigraph.html and https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/multidigraph.html how to enumerate all edges between two given vertices.  (In fact I ask because I forgot how to do this.)
issue
Minimal of a value of edges of a path#TITLE_END#I need to find all paths with highest (among all paths) minimal "preservance" along the path of a given multidigraph starting from a given node and ending with a given node.  "Preservance" is a numeric characteristic of an edge (like weight, but different).  It is like finding the shortest path, but instead to take a sum of weights I take the minimum of preservances.  Maybe a method to do this already exists, but I can't find a reference to it in https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html - In this case, it is a documentation bug. That page should refer to this algorithm.
issue
Finding paths in multigraphs#TITLE_END#https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.generic.shortest_path.html refers to a "shortest path" algorithm implementation.  This algorithm is not suitable for multigraphs, as for a multigraph a path is not specified by a node list.  Please add multigraph version of this algorithm, which should return a list of edges, not a list of nodes.
