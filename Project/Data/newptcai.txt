rom_prufer_sequence report "ValueError: too many values to unpack"#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  If you try the following code ``` import networkx as nx nx.from_prufer_sequence([7, 5, 5, 3, 1]) ``` you will get ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/home/xing/miniconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/tree/coding.py", line 396, in from_prufer_sequence     u, v = orphans ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2) ```  ### Expected Behavior  The code should return a tree without any problem.
