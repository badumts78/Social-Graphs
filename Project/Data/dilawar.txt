However on openSUSE Tumbleweed and Arch Linux, I am getting the following error:  ```  File "./schedule_aws.py", line 128, in main     schedule_aws( )   File "./schedule_aws.py", line 120, in schedule_aws     reformat( )   File "./schedule_aws.py", line 39, in reformat     speakers = g_.successors( 'source' )   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/classes/digraph.py", line 779, in successors     return iter(self._succ[n]) AttributeError: 'DiGraph' object has no attribute '_succ' ```  Version:  ``` python3 -c 'import networkx;print(networkx.__version__)' 2.0 ```
