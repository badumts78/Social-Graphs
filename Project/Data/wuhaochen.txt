Require strongly connected to compute average shortest path length.#TITLE_END#As mentioned in #3266 
issue
Add Floyd-Warshall for average_shortest_path_length#TITLE_END#I just find that the function `average_shortest_path_length` by default is using the Dijkstra's algorithm to computer all pairs of shortest path, which is inefficient for dense graph. It doesn't support using Floyd-Warshall algorithm. I'm no sure if we should make this as the default as well.  I can send a PR if you think this change is reasonable.
issue
Add method floyd-warshall to average_shortest_path_length#TITLE_END#Per #3266. Also changed the interface a bit so that unweighted network can use specific method.
issue
make filter view work for unicode node name in py2.#TITLE_END#This fixes #3180.  However I'm worrying there might be other places that trying to format a unicode character may cause problems. I did a quick search for `format` and didn't find other spots like this but I might no be thorough.

issue
Make to_pandas_edgelist behave consistent across py2 and py3#TITLE_END#Address #2977. Using OrderedDict here might be an overkill though.
issue
Fix bugs in all_node_cuts, address #3025#TITLE_END#Address #3025.  I made quite some changes to the original implementation and this probably need to be carefully reviewed.  The code correctly find much more cuts from `torrents_and_ferraro_graph` and doesn't need to deal with cycle graph separately. However it's also significantly slower than before, so I turned off a few tests for now.  I will explain a bit about the changes later and probably add more comments, but I'd like to get some feedback.
issue
Handle negatively weighted edges in bellman-ford, fixes #3130#TITLE_END#When negatively weighted edges are present, skipping nodes with longer distance than destination could miss better path. See example added in test case.  This should fix #3130.
issue
Add missing files to distribution.#TITLE_END#This PR adds all missing docs and examples to distribution. Fixes #2954.  However I noticed that in `setup.py` we are also installing all examples to the `share/` folder and i believe that the original intention also include installing all the content in `doc/` to the `share/` folder. Currently only txt files are installed to the `share/` folder though.  These piece of code originates from 10 years ago and I'm not sure if we still want to do this. I kept what it was for now but we may want to review it.
issue
Add bipartite layout#TITLE_END#Add a simple layout for bipartite graph.  I also noticed that all the functions in layout.py used numpy but some checked if numpy is installed while others didn't. Shall we make them more consistent? Personally I don't think checking and raise a new error is necessary. If we remove all the checks we can bring up the code coverage a bit as well.

change in pandas breaks doctest in python 3.6#TITLE_END#It looks like that the recent change in pandas: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/19884 is breaking one of the doctest in python 3.6.  I'm not sure what would be the best solution here since py2 and py3 behave differently and the difference is not crucial at all.

nodes() performance issue in Python2.#TITLE_END#nodes() function calls dict.items() and in Python 2 dict.items() returns a list instead of an iterator which could cause significant overhead compare to Python 3 especially when the graph is large. It seems it's not so easy to have an elegant solution to this. Should we do something about this? Any suggestions?

Implement reciprocity for directed graph.#TITLE_END#Implemented Issue #731   This Issue has been there for a while and it seems no one want to touch it so I just did it by myself. The styles of the file are based on other similar modules. 
comment
I remember we had some discussions about the `rescale_layout` function when I introduced a layout for bipartite networks. You might find #2976 and #2986 helpful.
comment
What I'm doing with my research is basically adding labels containing layer information to nodes and edges. I'm also working on an extension for multiplex network but it's still very preliminary and it may not work well with more general multi-layer networks.
comment
The third one is not a proper Japanese character, it's a [Translingual Symbol](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%BF%B1) indicating that two CJK ideographs are to be arranged together vertically to form a new ideograph, therefore it might not be supported by some fonts.
comment
The problem is trickier than that. It seems that there is something to do with the step   > Find k vertices with the largest degrees.  in the algorithm.  The graph is 1-separating therefore k=1. However we have three different choices of largest degree nodes namely 'b', 'c' and 'd'. The output is correct if 'c' is chosen and incorrect otherwise. I'll read the original paper a bit more and see how this should be solved.
comment
I have read the paper and code carefully and I'm not sure the implementation follows the algorithm described in the paper closely.  In particular, I don't understand why antichains map to closed sets in: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/connectivity/kcutsets.py#L153  I'm also not sure why the cycle graph need to be addressed separately. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/connectivity/kcutsets.py#L92  It seems that @jtorrents wrote the code originally. Could you take a look? Thanks.
comment
It also seems that we don't have a function for [Closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_problem). It might be a good time to implement it if it's the case.
comment
Thank you. I found several places that need to be fixed and I'm finalizing them now.  We do have a function to compute the transitive closure so I don't think we need another function for  closures.
comment
The attributes of a node is not a positional arguments. You might want to use ** to unpack the dict. ``` G = nx.DiGraph()  G.add_node((-77.3068519635211, 38.846374513181665), **{'id': 1, 'ShpName': 'nodes'}) ``` This would work.
comment
#2936 should have fixed this.
comment
I run a diff on pypi release and github release and found more missing files, which may also be the cause of #2941. I'll send a PR later.
comment
I think this is because pypi release doesn't have a README.txt in examples/advanced and therefore sphinx is not building there.  #2950 should have fixed this.
comment
I can't reproduce this error. How did you get the networkx? Does it come with the example dir and is there a README.txt in it?
comment
Thank you. It looks like a distribution issue.
comment
You can just pull in it now. Alternatively you can download source from this repo(dev-version) or github release page(Release version https://github.com/networkx/networkx/releases).
comment
@hagberg I just read the code, it seems the problem is in the filter_lines function in gml.py (L206-207, also L274-275), the '\n' in the end of a line is explicitly deleted there. Is it necessary?(Probably yes since len(line) is used later, but I'm not sure, alternately we can change the pattern to r'[A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z_]*(\s+|$)') The lines before(L204-205) are also suspicious, L205 probably should be line = str(line).  Update: There is another error regarding to Unicode and I've already spent enough time and I'll work on this.
