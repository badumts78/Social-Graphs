Contributing biologically motivated models#TITLE_END#Hi!  I have implemented graph generators for two models commonly used for analysis of protein interaction networks: the partial duplication model and the duplication-divergence model. Since these graph generators may be of use to others in the field of proteomics/bioinformatics I wondered if the networkx developers were interested in such generators.  In case you are, I was wondering where they should be placed? It may make sense to put them in a separate module for biological graph generators. If not, I think that they should be placed as random graph generators.
