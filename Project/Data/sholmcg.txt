issue
cycle_basis() and copy() inconsistency #TITLE_END#I'm running the following code on graphs:  ``` def compute_betti(G):     #Compute cycle basis     cb = nx.cycle_basis(G)      #Compute Betti number of graph     betti = 0     for cycle in cb:         if len(cycle)>3:             betti += 1      #Return (betti number, graph size, cyclomatic number)     return betti, len(G.nodes()), len(cb) ```  When I run:  ``` G = nx.read_adjlist(some_file) #original graph  H = G.copy() #deep copy J = nx.Graph(G) #shallow copy  compute_betti(G)  compute_betti(H)  compute_betti(J) ```  the result of compute_betti differs between G and both copies. Now, literally all that compute_betti is doing, as you can see, is counting the amount of basis cycles that are greater than length 3 -  this certainly shouldn't differ between 'identical graphs'. So this leads me to believe there is some sort of issue with the way copy() affects the result of cycle_basis().   EDIT: I'm doubting whether the sentence 'this certainly shouldn't differ between 'identical graphs'.' is true. That being said, I think the answer here is still worth clarifying - also, having identical cycle bases for graphs generated using .copy() would be useful.
