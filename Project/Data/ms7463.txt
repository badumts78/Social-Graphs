[WIP][Feature] pure descendants (implemented as extension of topological_generations)#TITLE_END#Please let me know if opening a PR is premature. I'm assuming this can also be used as a forum to discuss the validity of this addition/extension, but would happy to move the discussion elsewhere.  See this discussion thread for more context: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/7151  ``` def _topo_gens(G, sources=None):     # extended topo_gen logic  def topo_gens(G):     return _topo_gens(G)  def pure_desc(G, sources):     descs = set()     for gen in _topo_gens(G, sources=sources):         descs |= set(gen)     descs - set(sources) ```  Tests to be added.
issue
[Feature] Topological Generations#TITLE_END#Please see the following NetworkX discussion for details: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/4755  In short:  an algorithm, mainly based on the existing topological sort, to break a DAG up into layers, such that all dependencies of a node in a layer appear in a layer before it.  ``` # Imagine all arrows pointing downwards in this DAG    F   G   |\ /| D | E |  \|/  |   B   C    \ /     A  Result: [[D, F, G],  [C, E],  [B],  [A]] ```
