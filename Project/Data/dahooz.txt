Can't pickle local object 'SubDiGraph.__init__.<locals>.<lambda>' in 2.1 release#TITLE_END### What I did:  Pickle a Subgraph of a DiGraph: ```python import networkx as nx graph = nx.DiGraph({"test1":["test2"],"test2":[], "test3":[]}) subgraph = graph.subgraph(["test1", "test2"]) nx.write_gpickle(subgraph, "poc.gpickle") ```  ## What should happen:  Pickle should be able to pickle the subgraph  ## What happens:  ``` $ python3 poc.py  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "poc.py", line 7, in <module>     nx.write_gpickle(subgr, "poc.gpickle")   File "<decorator-gen-402>", line 2, in write_gpickle   File "/home/dahooz/.pyenv/versions/PickleASubgraph_Release/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 227, in _open_file     result = func_to_be_decorated(*new_args, **kwargs)   File "/home/dahooz/.pyenv/versions/PickleASubgraph_Release/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gpickle.py", line 70, in write_gpickle     pickle.dump(G, path, protocol) AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'SubDiGraph.__init__.<locals>.<lambda>' ```  ## Meta-info:  ``` $ python3 --version Python 3.6.5 ```  ``` $ pip show networkx Name: networkx Version: 2.1  (= freshly installed from pip repo) ```  ## Reason:  This is probably due to the lambda used to invert the `filter_edge` function.   In the master branch this problem appears as well, but looks differently as there pickle can't handle the locally def'ed `reverse_edge` function. I did not want to clutter your issues, so I did not open up another bugreport for that.  Is this intended behaviour? If so, how sould I pickle a subgraph, or should I better use another format for saving a subgraph?
