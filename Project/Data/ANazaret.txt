Add support for finding maximal cliques containing a set of nodes#TITLE_END#### Adapt `find_clique` to accept a set of starting nodes that all cliques must contain Finding clique has an exponential running time.  It is common to want to find maximal cliques containing a **specific set of nodes**. There **exists actually already a function**: `algorithms.clique.cliques_containing_node`.  Unfortunately, this function `cliques_containing_node` simply computes all cliques and filters them down to the ones containing the target node. This is very naive and unusable in practice. Yet, the original clique algorithm of `algorithms.clique.find_cliques` can be quite easily adapted to start with our desired set of nodes.   I adapted the initialization of the algorithm in `find_cliques` to use such a set of starting nodes. `find_cliques` now accepts a `nodes` argument, the same `cliques_containing_node` has. There is no overhead complexity compared to a normal call where `nodes` is not provided and if `nodes` is specified, the clique algorithm is exponentially faster.  If this contribution seems appropriate, I would like to hear your thoughts on: * `find_cliques` also has a recursive implementation; I should also adapt it to accept `nodes` to be consistent * This enhancement makes `cliques_containing_node` obsolete [it was unusable and naive anyway]. It should be deprecated.  Thanks;
