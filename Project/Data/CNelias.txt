issue
Drawing fails as ```TypeError: '_AxesStack' object is not callable```#TITLE_END#<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  When I try to plot any type of graph created with networkx, I always get the ```TypeError: '_AxesStack' object is not callable``` error. There was a similar issue opened in 2022, but none of the proposed solutions managed to fix the issue on my machine.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Take the example from the documentation: ``` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  G = nx.dodecahedral_graph()  nx.draw(G)  # networkx draw()  plt.draw()  # pyplot draw() ``` it returns ``` Traceback (most recent call last):    Cell In[10], line 5     nx.draw(G)  # networkx draw()    File ~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_pylab.py:113 in draw     if cf._axstack() is None:  TypeError: '_AxesStack' object is not callable ```   Matplotlib version: 3.7.1 Python version: 3.10.9 NetworkX version: 3.1
