issue
“Unexpected SeqBase<T> length” from matplotlib's backend_agg.py#TITLE_END#I'm trying to use pylab and networkx to draw a directed-graph.  Below is a small demo script and the error it produces (and, the window created by pylab is empty).  Googling shows that this error was supposed to be fixed in mathplotlib's svn already in 2008.  Anyone could point me in the right direction?  This script:  <pre> import pylab import networkx as nx  def Working_with_graphs_using_networkx():     fig = pylab.figure()     g = nx.Graph(name = "graph")     pylab.title(g.name)     g.add_node("John")     g.add_node("Maria")     g.add_edge("John", "Maria")     pos = nx.spring_layout(g)     nx.draw(g, pos)  if __name__ == "__main__":     Working_with_graphs_using_networkx()     pylab.show() </pre>  Produces this error (on Python 2.6 under cygwin):  <pre> $ python demo_SeqBase.py Exception in Tkinter callback Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-tk/Tkinter.py", line 1410, in __call__     return self.func(*args)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_tkagg.py", line 236, in resize     self.show()   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_tkagg.py", line 239, in draw     FigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py", line 401, in draw     self.figure.draw(self.renderer)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py", line 55, in draw_wrapper     draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py", line 884, in draw     func(*args)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py", line 55, in draw_wrapper     draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/axes.py", line 1983, in draw     a.draw(renderer)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py", line 55, in draw_wrapper     draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/collections.py", line 238, in draw     self._linewidths, self._linestyles, self._antialiaseds, self._urls)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py", line 84, in draw_path_collection     return self._renderer.draw_path_collection(*kl, **kw) IndexError: Unexpected SeqBase<T> length. </pre>
