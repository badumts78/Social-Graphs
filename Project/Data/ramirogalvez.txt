> I believe we did it that way on purpose since in this case higher-weight (longer distance) leads to lower centrality and we thought it would be less confusing. In some cases you might e.g. want something like distance = 1/weight.  Hagberg, one question. Isn't this the exact case for betweeness centrality? However, in that case the name of the parameter is "weight" and not "distance". Or maybe I am not understanding correctly. Is it the case that in both cases (betweeness and closeness) the weights capture distances (something that one wants to minimize), or this is the case only for closeness?
