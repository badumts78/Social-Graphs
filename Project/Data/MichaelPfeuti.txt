louvain_partitions iteration difference#TITLE_END#louvain_partitions leads to different clusterings depending on how one iterates over the returned generator  ### Current Behavior If I iterate over the generator returned from louvain_partitions by a for loop I get for each iteration the expected clustering levels.  However, if I first create a list (or tuple, deque...) and then iterate over the list I get different results. In fact, the levels have certain clusters which are empty if I iterate over the list.   ### Expected Behavior I would expect that no matter how I iterate over the resulting generator I would get the same results.  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` import networkx as nx import networkx.algorithms.community as nx_comm  G = nx.path_graph(200)  def evaluate(part):     print(len(part))     count = 0     for nodes in part:         if len(nodes) == 0:             count += 1     print(f"\tEmpty Clusters: {count}")  louvian_clustering = list(nx_comm.louvain_partitions(G, resolution=1, seed=20)) for part in louvian_clustering:     evaluate(part)  print("----")  for part in nx_comm.louvain_partitions(G, resolution=1, seed=20):     evaluate(part) ``` Output ``` 90     Empty Clusters: 76  41     Empty Clusters: 27  17      Empty Clusters: 3  14     Empty Clusters: 0  ----  90     Empty Clusters: 0  41      Empty Clusters: 0  17     Empty Clusters: 0  14      Empty Clusters: 0 ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.10.5 NetworkX version: 2.8.5
