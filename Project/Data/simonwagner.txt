issue
networkx.algorithms.maximal_matching does not always return the correct result.#TITLE_END#networkx.algorithms.maximal_matching seems to sometimes generate bogus results.  For example the test case in https://gist.github.com/simonwagner/7679793#file-bug_matching-py will return `set([(303, 312), (308, 312)])` as matching - although that is clearly false.  Interestingly enough, it will return the correct result for exactly the same graph, if one recreates it from its edges. I would therefore conclude, that the bug stems from an incorrect handling of the vector ordering in an edge [(a,b) vs (b,a)] in an undirected graph.
