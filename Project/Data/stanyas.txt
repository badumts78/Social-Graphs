Adding an Example Map for GSoC Proposal#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  I am addressing the issue [5510](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5510).  Please, disregard the first two commits, this is my first time making a pull request, and I experimented.

Describing what the algorithms are helpful for with a brief visual and textual examples - a GSoC idea#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  The descriptions of algorithms [are missing](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/), so it is hard to know which are suitable. If one approaches the NetworkX without thorough background knowledge of graphs, they may not understand which of them would be helpful without a lengthy comprehensive googling.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  There can be an overview of the high-level working of the graph algorithms with an image.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  For example, if one does not know what a _cut_ is, they will need to google when looking at [this example](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/cuts.html).   ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: any NetworkX version: any  @MridulS , @dschult, @rossbar
issue
Find all cycles of given length in an undirected graph - documenting the solution#TITLE_END#In Stack Overflow, I found the [following question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44994389/find-all-cycles-of-given-length-networkx): "Given an undirected graph, how do you go about finding all cycles of length n (using networkx if possible). So input would be the Graph and n, and the function would return all cycles of that length." I want to look at it and document a solution in a notebook.

Hi Mridul,  I would like to work on the issue, plus its visualization. Is this the desired behavior?   Instead of ValueError, printing 'This is an empty graph.'  Instead of StopIteration, printing 'Only one edge.'  Instead of ZeroDivisionError, print 'No edges.'  Thanks.
