issue
Subtle bug in floyd_warshall_numpy#TITLE_END#floyd_warshall_numpy() assumes that the matrix returned by to_numpy_matrix() uses 0 for non-existing edges and replaces these with a np.inf However, this does not work for edges with weights of 0.  Take this network for example, (src_node) (dest_node) (edge_weight) 1 2 -2 2 3 -4 1 5 1 5 4 0 4 3 -5 2 5 -7  floyd_warshall_numpy() returns -9 as the shortest of the shortest paths. floyd_warshall() returns -14 which is the correct answer.  For a quick fix, I modified to_numpy_matrix() to initialise matrices using np.inf and removed floyd_warshall_numpy() code that replaces 0 with inf. This appeared to work.
