graphviz rendering issue#TITLE_END#If I have a networkx (version 1.11 from pip) graph G whose nodes are objects. The **repr** of these objects may be the same although they are distinct nodes. By manually setting label attribute on nodes I can happily have two distinct nodes rendered with the same text in them. I then convert this to AGraph and use the to_string() method to obtain the .dot graph.  However, when the edges are written into the dot file, they appear to use the **repr** of the nodes at either end, ignoring the label attribute set on those nodes. This leads to a graph being rendered with a completely different topology.  Happy to submit a working example if its not obvious what to do. I think (hope)someone more intimately familiar with the import structure and interplay between agraph and networkx will be able to recognise this problem immediately. Thanks all.
