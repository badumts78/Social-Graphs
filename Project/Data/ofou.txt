Convert crossing edges into new node?#TITLE_END#Hi! I'm a musician doing a musical investigation on the [circle of fifth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) and I'm new to networkx. I want to make new nodes from crossing edges. Is it possible to do that with nx?  I want to be able to analyze all the intersections of a complete K12 graph as musical notes of the circle and convert them into new nodes.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12256669/62189236-77c01f00-b33c-11e9-80b6-162fff790bb8.png)  ``` notes = ['C', 'G', 'D', 'A', 'E', 'B', 'F#', 'C#', 'G#', 'D#', 'A#', 'F'] M = nx.complete_graph(notes) pos = nx.draw_circular(M,  with_labels = True) ```
