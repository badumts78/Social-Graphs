Hi, I and @eikNamo are working together on this issue. We have got this initial result by plotting spectral clustering in scikit-learn with networkx graph object. Hope this helps! <img width="550" alt="scikit-learn-sc" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43605407/108960360-bf419500-76b0-11eb-910d-c28829d3a6d2.png">

> It's not at all clear what is shown here.  Thanks for your reply:) The first subplot is a dataset composed of two categories.  The dataset is then used as input for spectral clustering(without labels). The second subplot is the graph visualization of the clustering result in which each node represents each data point and each edge represents similarity between two nodes by affinity matrix.   Since spectral clustering algorithm is based on graph optimization, this example provides a chance for visualizing spectral clustering result in scikit-learn with the use of networkx graph object, so that users could manipulate the graph more easily to understand the clustering result.
