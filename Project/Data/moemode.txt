issue
eigenvector_centrality#TITLE_END#Hi all, the [documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality.html?highlight=eigenvector_centrality#networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality) of eigenvector_centrality defines **right** eigenvector centrality in its opening sentences (without mentioning **right** explicitly). However for directed graphs, networkx computes the **left** eigenvector centrality by default. I found this confusing and others might also. This could possibly be fixed by always being explicit about **left** and **right** eigenvector centrality and explaining the default behavior more towards the top of the page.
