Edge cases Laplacian centrality#TITLE_END#This code handles a few edge cases of the Laplacian centrality with empty, single-node, and unconnected (edgeless) graphs. Following changes have been made to the laplacian_centrality calculation  1. NetworkXPointlessConcept is raised for empty and single node graphs 2. NetworkXPointlessConcept is raised for graphs without edges and normalized=True (we can't normalize to 0.0)  Test cases are provided. The code has been reviewed, and review comments have been processed.  fixes https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6571, fixes https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6626

#6571 laplacian_centrality not working for graphs with single nodes#TITLE_END#My first pull request, so I fixed a simple issue to get acquainted with contributing.  It seems to be an issue that A_2 becomes degenerate, and the new_energy formula fails. A simple if check prevents this failure and provides a default value of 0.0.  I provided test cases to validate that the error was still present before the fix and that the problem was solved with the fix.  @rossbar @PurviChaurasia @Qudirah @navyagarwal - I hope this helps and does not get in your way - I would love to become an official contributor to networkx!
