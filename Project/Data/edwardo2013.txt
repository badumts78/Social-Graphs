Added euler path for Graphs, Digraphs and Multigraphs#TITLE_END#We added the file find_euler_path.py which has an implementation of the euler path algorithm. It is general: It works for Graphs, Digraphs and Multigraphs. We added some tests after the function. It uses the eulerian_circuit() function, which is implemented in euler.py . We make the comments following the aforementioned file.  Please tell us is this is the way to document the function. If not, provide information/files to add the required documentation.  About the code: the function receives a networkx graph G. If G is eulerian, then just returns the eulerian circuit. If not, then verify degree condition of nodes to see if it has an euler path. If it does not have it, raise an error. Then, at line 145 the code to find the euler path is given (this works because we know that we have the conditions to have an euler path). It returns a generator which has the euler path.   Please review this code, we would be happy to see it merged in the networkx project. Please let us know if some changes must be made (emails are in the file) or if it is posible to make the code more compact.  Thanks, Edwardo S. Rivera
