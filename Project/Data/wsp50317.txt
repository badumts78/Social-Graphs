issue
LPA algorithm may have some problems with the directed graph and weights.#TITLE_END#LPA algorithm can work with the directed graph in the developed version. (Maybe it's solved by #3545) But it seems that it has some problems when the input is a directed graph with weights. Below is a simple program and the output:  Program: ``` import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from networkx.algorithms import community  DG = nx.DiGraph() DG.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.5), (3, 1, 0.75)]) communities_generator = list(community.asyn_lpa_communities(DG, weight = 'weight')) nx.draw(DG, with_labels=True, font_weight='bold') plt.show() ```  Output: ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/wu/PerformanceAnalysis/Perf/Ros/Label_progation/test/test.py", line 21, in <module>     communities_generator = list(community.asyn_lpa_communities(DG, weight = 'weight'))   File "</usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/decorator.py:decorator-gen-508>", line 2, in asyn_lpa_communities   File "/home/wu/networkx/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 464, in _random_state     return func(*new_args, **kwargs)   File "/home/wu/networkx/networkx/algorithms/community/label_propagation.py", line 88, in asyn_lpa_communities     if weight else 1})   File "/home/wu/networkx/networkx/classes/reportviews.py", line 930, in __getitem__     return self._adjdict[u][v] KeyError: 1  ``` 
issue
Fix the direction of edges in label_propagation.py#TITLE_END#The nodes in the function of label_freq.update are opposite.
