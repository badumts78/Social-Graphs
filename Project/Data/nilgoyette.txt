Wrong doc or behavior for simple_cycles#TITLE_END#On 1.9.1, we can read on simple_cycles' documentation: Returns:    cycle_generator: generator A generator that produces elementary cycles of the graph. **Each cycle is a list of nodes with the first and last nodes being the same.** [emphasis added]  I wrote a simple test case and the result doesn't respect the sentence in bold.  ``` python >>> import networkx as nx >>> graph = nx.DiGraph() >>> graph.add_nodes_from(['A', 'B', 'C']) >>> graph.add_edges_from({('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'A')}) >>> list(nx.simple_cycles(graph)) [['A', 'B', 'C']] ```  I thought the result would be `[['A', 'B', 'C', 'A']]` I also tested on the latest release 1.10 and I obtain the same result.
