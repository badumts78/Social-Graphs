issue
girvan_newman ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence#TITLE_END#First off, I'm running Python 3.4.3 and NetworkX 2.0.dev20151006145736 (installed earlier today from the latest Git master).  I have a simple graph (download the pickle [here](http://gfairchild.com/public/en_Influenza_1.pickle)) that I'm trying to run `girvan_newman` on:  ``` python communities = nx.girvan_newman(graph) pprint.pprint(list(communities)) ```  I'm getting the following error:  ``` > ./community_detection.py ../data/en_Influenza_1.pickle  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "./community_detection.py", line 32, in <module>     communities = nx.girvan_newman(args.graph)   File "[path]/env/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/community/centrality.py", line 39, in girvan_newman     _remove_max_edge(g, weight)   File "[path]/env/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/community/centrality.py", line 61, in _remove_max_edge     max_value = max(betweenness.values()) ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence ```  I'm guessing there's just an edge case in the `girvan_newman` code that was missed.
