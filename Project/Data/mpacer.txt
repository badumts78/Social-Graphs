issue
Sphinx inconsistent in including source code in documentation: e.g., Graph.edges() & DiGraph.edges()#TITLE_END#The ability to immediately see the source code when reading documentation is extremely helpful. An example of where this is straightforward can be found at   https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.Graph.edges.html#networkx.Graph.edges  which links to:   https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/_modules/networkx/classes/graph.html#Graph.edges  However, this is not a feature that is consistently available throughout the documentation despite the documentation being auto-built using sphinx. For example,  https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.DiGraph.edges.html#networkx.DiGraph.edges  has no link to a representation of the source code. There _is_ code in the documentation for the [`DiGraph` class](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/_modules/networkx/classes/digraph.html), and a link from the top level class to the source in the documentation. However, if you look for the analogous `edges` method under the `DiGraph` class, it doesn't exist!   Of course the method (`edges`) in both the `Graph` and `DiGraph` classes exists, and the docstrings are fairly extensive in both of them. But for some reason sphinx did not include this when the docs are built. I figured that the [autoclass and automethod calls](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/doc/rst_templates/autosummary/class.rst) were building the classes documentation for both `DiGraph` and `Graph`, but then it makes no sense why it would successfully include `edges()` in one case and exclude them in the other. I also can't find anything that explicitly excludes `edges()` in the DiGraph case, so I'm a bit at a loss.  Sidenote: I was going to try to build the documents to see if I could figure out what was going on and commit a fix if I could…but in attempting to get my fork & local in a state that is consistent with the current master branch I have gotten into a spiral of git confusion where my local repo says its consistent both with this repo (`upstream`) and my fork (`origin`) but github says that my fork is ahead by commits that seem to be included in this repo! So all the time I was going to devote to trying to fix that instead went into this whirlpool of gittitude trying to arrive at some kind of a consistent state. Was there some kind of history rewriting that went on in the past couple of months? If so, could you put a note warning that this occurred and instructions on how to avoid these kinds of issues (even if it's just suggesting to people that they nuke their repo and start over).
