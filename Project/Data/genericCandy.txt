issue
Some methods doesn't work on child classes of graphs#TITLE_END#When working on child classes of `nx.Graph` (I assume it is the same for all graph classes) that have other `__init__` parameters, some methods (for example subgraph) fail since they try to access the `__init__` of the child class instead of the `__init__` of the parent class   ### Current Behavior The method tries to access the `__init__` of the child class with the parameters for the parent class (`nx.Graph` in my case), and fails  In the example below, it returned : ``` TypeError: Child.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data' ```  ### Expected Behavior The method should access the `__init__` of its first ancestor in {"nx.Graph", "nx.DiGraph", "nx.MultiGraph", ...}  ### Steps to Reproduce Execute this Python script :  ``` import networkx as nx  class Child(nx.Graph):     def __init__(self, data):         super().__init__(self)         self.data = data  G = Child("some data") G.add_nodes_from(range(5)) G.subgraph([1, 2, 3]) ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.10.5 NetworkX version: 2.8
