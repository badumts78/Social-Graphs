Replacing xml with defusedxml to prevent XML External Entity injection attacks (XXE)#TITLE_END#https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/2eb274e39f712047cebf5666ee9caf2ba2e51ee4/networkx/readwrite/gexf.py#L20  The standard `xml` library is vulnerable to XXE and other denial of service attacks that could impact security of any service making use of this library when parsing XML-based files.   In general, it should be as easy as replacing the current import with `defusedxml.ElementTree`, however, the `register_namespace` function is not available in the `defusedxml` package. So there is some work-around needed here.
