issue
networkx.simple_cycles fails to run#TITLE_END#Hello,  I would like to use networkx to find simple cycles in an undirected graph. I tried a couple of undirected graph examples, and they worked without any issues. However, some of them failed. By failing, I mean the networkx.simple_cycles never returned anything, and the Command prompt window just runs to infinity. Here is one graph which fails: ![graph_preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4411411/30512077-e78f6fc2-9ae6-11e7-962d-1c18392fb910.png)   Here is the code that I used:  ``` import networkx  graph = { 0: [30, 29, 3, 2],  1: [29, 27, 4, 3],  2: [26, 0, 5, 22],  3: [0, 1, 6, 5],  4: [1, 25, 20, 6],  5: [2, 3, 8, 7],  6: [3, 4, 9, 8],  7: [22, 5, 10, 18],  8: [5, 6, 11, 10],  9: [6, 20, 17, 11],  10: [7, 8, 13, 16],  11: [8, 9, 15, 13], 12: [64, 15, 63, 13],  13: [10, 11, 12, 14],  14: [62, 13, 61, 16],  15: [11, 12, 40, 17],  16: [10, 14, 60, 18],  17: [9, 15, 41, 19],  18: [7, 16, 59, 21],  19: [42, 17, 43, 20],  20: [4, 9, 19, 23],  21: [18, 58, 57, 22],  22: [2, 7, 24, 21],  23: [44, 20, 45, 25],  24: [22, 56, 55, 26],  25: [4, 23, 46, 27],  26: [2, 24, 54, 30], 27: [1, 25, 47, 28],  28: [48, 27, 49, 29],  29: [1, 0, 28, 31],  30: [0, 26, 52, 31],  31: [50, 29, 51, 30],  32: [59],  33: [40],  34: [61],  35: [56],  36: [43],  37: [46],  38: [50],  39: [53],  40: [15, 33, 64, 41],  41: [17, 40, 42],  42: [19, 41, 43],  43: [19, 36, 42, 44],  44: [23, 43, 45],  45: [23, 44, 46],  46: [25, 37, 45, 47],  47: [27, 46, 48],  48: [28, 47, 49],  49: [28, 48, 50],  50: [31, 38, 49, 51],  51: [31, 50, 52],  52: [30, 51, 53],  53: [39, 52, 54],  54: [26, 53, 55],  55: [24, 54, 56],  56: [24, 35, 55, 57],  57: [21, 56, 58], 58: [21, 57, 59],  59: [18, 32, 58, 60],  60: [16, 59, 61],  61: [14, 34, 60, 62], 62: [14, 61, 63],  63: [12, 62, 64],  64: [12, 40, 63] }  G = networkx.DiGraph(graph) print "simple_cycles: ", (list(networkx.simple_cycles(G))) ```  I have python 2.7.13, and when networkx is installed I got the following infromation: decorator 4.1.2 networkx 1.11.  Is this some sort of bug?  I would be grateful for any kind of reply.  Kind regards, Djordje
