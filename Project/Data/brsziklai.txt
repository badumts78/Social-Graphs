maximum_flow() bug#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  The `maximum_flow()` function produces flow cycles for certain directed graphs. In particular, it can happen that more flow leaves the source than what enters the sink. This can be a serious problem for the network operator as circulating extra amount of wares can be quite expensive.  ### Expected Behavior  Augmenting paths should increase the flow from source to sink, thus no flow cycles should appear.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Here is a minimal working example:  ``` import networkx as nx import random as rd  rd.seed(3)  G=nx.erdos_renyi_graph(100, 0.04, seed=21, directed=True)  for i,j in G.out_edges():     G[i][j]['weight']=rd.randint(10,45)      fv, fd =nx.maximum_flow(G, 0, 99, capacity='weight')  print('flow value: ', fv) for key in fd:     for key2 in fd[key]:         if fd[key][key2] !=0:             print('edge(',key, ',', key2, ') flow: ', fd[key][key2], sep='') ```  The amount of flow (113) that leaves the source (node 0) is greater than the total flow (100). This is because some flow returns from nodes 24 and 47. In addition, there are large cycles in the graph that circulate flows.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  I am currently using jupyter notebook.
