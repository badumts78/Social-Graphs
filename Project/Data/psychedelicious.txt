> We see in practice that type annotations can make it hard, even for experienced Python developers, to follow code.  Coming from someone with a fairly weak understanding of python - python is far less intelligible without type annotations. Yes, python types aren't as expressive or ergonomic as in other languages, but they are better than nothing. Adding some generics would make this library far more usable.  Static type analyzers (mypy, pyright) and runtime data validation libraries (pydantic, msgspec) are ubiquitous for modern applications. "Types make it harder" is a _very_ hard sell.  Inline annotations are strongly preferred over external stub, because it's much easier to understand the annotations in context.
