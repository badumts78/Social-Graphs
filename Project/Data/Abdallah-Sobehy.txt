issue
minimum_node_cut gives a wrong result if there is an edge between source and target nodes in an directed Graph#TITLE_END#For the simple graph generated by the following code:   ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from([0,1,2,3,4]) G.add_edges_from([(0,1),(0,2),(1,3),(3,4),(2,3)], weight = 1) print nx.algorithms.connectivity.minimum_node_cut(G,1,0) ```  The output is `set([2])`.  While clearly, even with removing node 2 there would still be a path between 0 and 1 which is directly between them. I believe the proper output should be an empty set indicating there is no possible node cut.

I believe it is the minimum_cut function is the one you are looking for. Actually, using it produced the results you are expecting. Here is how I used it for your example.  ``` cut_weight, partitions = nx.minimum_cut(G, "s", "t") print "cut edges capacity " + str(cut_weight) # The total weigh of edge_cut # Produces 10 print "Set of nodes in the 's' partition: " + str(partitions[0]) # Set of nodes in the partition containing s # Produces ['a', 'c', 'b', 'e', 's'] print "Set of nodes in the 't' partition: " + str(partitions[1]) # Set of nodes in the partition containing t # Produces (['d', 't', 'f']) edge_cut_list = [] # edge_cut is simply the edges between both partitions computed by the following nested loop. for p1_node in partitions[0]:     for p2_node in partitions[1]:         if G.has_edge(p1_node,p2_node):             edge_cut_list.append((p1_node,p2_node)) print "Edges of the cut: " + str(edge_cut_list) # Produces the expected result: [('a', 'd'), ('c', 'f'), ('e', 't')] ```

I am not really familiar with auxillary, and residual network so my response might be late for that. But when I figure something out I shall let you as soon as I can.
