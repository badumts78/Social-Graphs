issue
breadth-first search is not exhaustive#TITLE_END#I believe it is an error that `bfs_edges` does not yield **all** edges reachable from the source node, but only one edge per reachable target node.  This is true for the [PADS blueprint](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/BFS.py), with the difference that this fact is clearly stated in the docstring there:  > Edges that connect vertices within the same level are not included in the output.  Minimal example: ```Python import networkx as nx  graph = nx.DiGraph() graph.add_nodes_from(range(9)) graph.add_edge(0, 1) graph.add_edge(0, 2) graph.add_edge(1, 2) graph.add_edge(2, 3) graph.add_edge(3, 4) graph.add_edge(4, 5) graph.add_edge(5, 6) graph.add_edge(6, 7) graph.add_edge(6, 8) graph.add_edge(7, 8)  edges = nx.bfs_edges(graph, 0) assert set(edges) == set(graph.edges) ```
