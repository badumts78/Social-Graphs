issue
Inconsistent order of .edges()#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> The order of the edges returned by `.edges()` is not ordered  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen --> As networkx graphs are build around python dict, I would expect that the output of `.edges()` is ordered.   ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ```   edges1 = list(sorted([(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 0)]))   g1 = nx.DiGraph(edges1)   print(edges1 == list(g1.edges)) # gives False      edges2 = list(sorted([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)]))   g2 = nx.DiGraph(edges2)   print(edges2 == list(g2.edges)) # gives True ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version:  3.9.16  NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
