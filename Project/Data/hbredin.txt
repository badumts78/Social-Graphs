issue
nx.density ZeroDivisionError for graph with one node and one self-loop edge#TITLE_END#I found one of my script to fail when calling nx.blockmodel for some graphs. I narrowed it down to a bug in nx.density when applied on a graph with one node and one self-loop edge:  ``` >>> dummy = nx.Graph() >>> dummy.add_edge('a', 'a') >>> nx.density(dummy) Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/classes/function.py", line 97, in density   d= m*2.0/float(n*(n-1)) ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero ```  I do not know exactly what the result should be but I guess raising a ZeroDivisionError is not the expected output.
