subgraph_isomorphisms_iter() but with approximate matchings instead of isomorphisms#TITLE_END#Hello,  I have a data graph and a pattern graph, both directed with categorical edge labels. Currently, I am able to use the subgraph_isomorphisms_iter() function for pattern matching to find matches of pattern graph with the (subgraphs of) data graph; which returns exact matches (subgraph isomorphisms).  However, I'd like to be able to get approximate matches as well, an example criteria for approximate matching could be ` "Graph Edit Distance < N"` (or some other similarity measures?).  Is this possible?  One way I can think of is to iterate over all the possible subgraphs of the data graph (like `for subgraph in nx.connected_component_subgraphs(data_graph):`) and calculate the GED of each such subgraph with the pattern graph. Then choose the subgraphs with GED < N.   I am wondering if there's a better way because iterating over `2^[num_edges(data_graph)]` subgraphs would not be efficient because, for example, we need not even consider those subgraphs with `num_edges(pattern_graph) - N  < num_edges(subgraph) < num_edges(pattern_graph) + N ` as the edit distance would surely be greater than N for these subgraphs.   Am I thinking in the right direction?  Are there any in-built methods to achieve this?  Are there any completely different algorithms/approaches in the literature to achieve what I am trying to?  Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.
