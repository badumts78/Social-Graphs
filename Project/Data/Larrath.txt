Inconsistent documentation nbunch parameter in DiGraph.edges()#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> The [documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.DiGraph.edges.html) of the *edges* function for DiGraphs is misleading due to the description of the *nbunch* parameter, which is contradictory to the rest of the function's documentation:  > **nbunch : single node, container, or all nodes (default= all nodes)** The view will only report edges incident to these nodes.  Under 'notes', it is stated:  > For directed graphs this returns the out-edges.  It can also be noticed that the function returns an OutEdgeView object.  In terms of the code functionality itself, DiGraph.edges(n) will only return the outgoing edges of the node *n*.  ### Expected Behavior The description of the parameter *nbunch* should be updated to reflect and emphasize the fact that only **outgoing edges** belonging to these nodes will be returned, and not **incident edges**.  I also believe it might be helpful to expand on the Example section and directly show:  ```python G = nx.DiGraph() nx.add_path(G, [0, 1, 2]) G.edges(0) # <- Returns the edge (0, 1) in a View G.edges(2) # <- Returns an empty list in a View ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.6.2
