`dfs_preorder_nodes` already serves this purpose (remove source to get descendants).  I guess the reason that  `descendants` and `ancestors` are implemented in `networkx.algorithms.dag` is because of terminology? Because those terms may only make sense for a DAG (and trees), although the same algorithms can be applied on general graphs to get "nodes reachable from u" and "nodes from which u is reachable" (they may not be disjoint for non-DAGs) If we decide to call these also "descendants" and "ancestors", then they should be moved out of `networkx.algorithms.dag`.  Another thing that I noticed is that both `dag.descendants` and `dag.ancestors` are sub-optimal complexity-wise because they use `shortest_path_length` (which will default to something like dijkstra or bellman-ford). They should be using a basic traveral algorithm (like `dfs_preorder_nodes` does) to achieve a time complexity of O(V+E).  Would the devs here be interested in a PR re-writing `descendants` and `ancestors` (and maybe moving them out of `networkx.algorithms.dag`)?
