issue
The min_weight_matching function gives wrong result, and the behaviour is not the same as max_weight_matching#TITLE_END#### Problem description  When I give a bipartite graph as input, I believe the max_weight_matching will return the maximum-weight matching. Then I take the negation of the weights, and using the min_weight_matching function I should obtain the same result. But the min_weight_matching does not.  The code is as follows: ```python import networkx  if __name__ == "__main__":     edges = [         (1, 11, 24), (1, 14, 2),         (2, 12, 14), (2, 13, 2),         (3, 12, 1),         (4, 15, 10),         (5, 11, 3)     ]      graph = networkx.Graph()     for (l_idx, r_idx, dist) in edges:         graph.add_weighted_edges_from([(l_idx, r_idx, dist)])     match = networkx.max_weight_matching(graph)     result = sorted([(a, b) if a < 10 else (b, a) for a, b in match])     print("num of matchings: ", len(result))     print(result)     print("---" * 30)      graph = networkx.Graph()     for (l_idx, r_idx, dist) in edges:         graph.add_weighted_edges_from([(l_idx, r_idx, -dist)])  # take the negative     match = networkx.min_weight_matching(graph)     result = sorted([(a, b) if a < 10 else (b, a) for a, b in match])     print("num of matchings: ", len(result))     print(result) ``` The result is  ```python num of matchings:  3 [(1, 11), (2, 12), (4, 15)] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ num of matchings:  5 [(1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 15), (5, 11)] ``` I give a bipartite graph, the graph has two vertex set, one is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the other is {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}. Then I run the max_weight_matching, the result is correct. The total sum of weight is 24 + 14 + 10 = 48. But when I take the negation of the weights, and run min_weight_matching, the result is not as expected. It returns 5 matchings and the total sum of weight is 2 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 3 = 18.  ### Environment ```python python == 3.11.5 networkx == 3.1 ```  ### The possible reason The related issue is 5538 https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5388  Someone reports a bug in min_weight_matching function, then @dschult change the behaviour of min_weight_matching and let the maxcardinality parameter to be True.  But when maxcardinality is True, it will return the maximum number of matches, and then select the one with the highest weight. However, when maxcardinality is False, it just return the matches with highest weight. I believe the maxcardinality = False is the right behaviour as I expect. I can simply run max_weight_matching(maxcardinality=True) and get 5 matches with total weight 18, just the same as min_weight_mathcing().  And if I modify the source code and run min_weight_matching(maxcardinality=False), I will get the right answer with 3 matches 48 weights.
