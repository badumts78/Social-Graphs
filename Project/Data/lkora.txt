algorithms.tree.branchings breaks for all minimum_branching() calls#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior Inside of `Edmonds` class, `find_optimum()` method, there is an if statement that checks if the `desired_edge()` method found a valid edge ``` # If weight < 0, then it cannot help in finding a maximum branching.    if self.style == "branching" and weight <= 0:       acceptable = False ``` Due to the way the `Edmonds` class was implemented, when calling the `minimum_branching()`, or `minimum_spanning_arborescence()`, all of the weights of the graph are set to their negative values. So the above if statement doesn't pass and add any branches. So the **return value** of the `minimum_branching()` call is **always a set of nodes, but without any edges**. ![broken](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17961880/119535566-6e613b80-bd88-11eb-8fe2-a38d83b64c9d.png)   ### Expected Behavior **The minimum directed edges should be created between the nodes.**  The conversion to negative weights for minimum `minimum_branching()` and also `minimum_spanning_arborescence()` is pointless and the solution should be rewritten, the current fix that works for my examples is to remove the aforementioned if statement from above, and just leave `acceptable = True`. I have made a pull request with it.   ### Steps to Reproduce Just call either `minimum_branching()`, or `minimum_spanning_arborescence()` for any graph that has positive edge weights.   ### Environment Conda version: 4.10.1 Python version: 3.8.5 NetworkX version: 2.5.1   ### Additional information The existing codebase needs to be rewritten, or at least refactored.
