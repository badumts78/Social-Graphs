Bugfix /docfix for MappedQueue, issue 5681#TITLE_END#  - Added Tests         - test __gt__ in _HeapElement when priorities are tied.         - test dictionary input in MappedQueue         - test tied priorities         - verify exception is raised for incomparable elements         - tests for the `pop` method when dictionaries are the input.  - Fixed `__gt__` bug  - Added the exception for incomparable elements. Include a helpful error message.  - Added Examples           - show that incomparable elements will fail           - show how to fix incomparable elements by assigning priorities via a dict.  - Update the doc_string descriptions to explain assigning priorities via a dict.   - Added a reference to `MappedQueue` in the `networkx/reference/utils.rst` file.      I needed to check the formatting of the doc_string. This was the only way I     knew to get `numpydocs` to format the doc_string. I can take it back out. - Changed the signature of the class to not use a mutable argument.  Instead of ```python class MappedQueue(data=[]) ``` I wrote, ```python class MappedQueue(data=None) ``` and wrote a few lines to deal with `None`. I can take this back out too.  In fact, I am not emotionally tied to any of my changes :-) I'm looking forward to feedback. Thanks

docstring updates for `union`, `disjoint_union`, and `compose`#TITLE_END#Updated docstrings for `union`, `disjoint_union`, and `compose`. resolves #5828   - Added explanations on how these three operators differ and some hints on which use case would be appropriate. - Added notes to link users to their other choices. - Graph.update() was also added as an alternate choice, but no changes were made to the docstring of Graph.update().  Please review and comment.  Note: once there is agreement on the changes, they should also be rolled into `union_all`, `disjoint_union_all`, `compose_all` to be consistent.

signature change for `node_link` functions: for issue #5787#TITLE_END#Signature change for `node_link` functions resolves #5787. Attributes are passed by keyword instead of a dictionary.  Not yet complete. *** The deprecation warnings need to be edited to include the target version for the change ***  Tests - Tests were added to check the new signature with keywords. - A test was added to verify that the warning message is triggered when the old style signature is used. - Tests that check the old style signatures were kept, but were tagged with TODO comments for deletion.  Docs - The doc strings were updated with deprecation notices - *** The examples in the doc strings still need updating.

How about adding this text to the notes for `write_adjlist`?  > If spaces are embedded in the names of nodes, the parser in `read_adjlist` will be confused becasue _space_ is the default delimiter. The parser will not know if a _space_ belongs in the node name or is just a delimiter. To avoid this problem, specify an alternate delimiter when spaces are valid in node names.  A similar note should be added to `generate_adjlist`.  It has the same issue.

Please don't wait on me. I've submitted what I have. I don't have any work pending.

I'd like to be assigned to this issue. I've read through the discussion in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4208. I think I can clarify the difference between `union`, `disjoint_union`, `compose` and `Graph.update`  The first time I wanted to combine two graphs, I started at `union`, which was not what I really wanted. It took me a while to find compose. I can leave some descriptive bread crumbs in the "See Also" section.  Also, can an update the `operators` module so the descriptions there are consistent with the updates elsewhere.  There were some comments about improving the error message of `union`, which I could do, but perhaps that was meant to be raised in a separate issue.
comment
I made PR# 5892.  The docstrings for `union`, `disjoint_union`, and `compose` all point to each other and to `Graph.update()`.  And there is a breadcrumb statement that suggests why an alternative might be useful.  I tried to write the first line description to include a hint about about the way common nodes and edges are treated.  And I tried to begin the descriptions with more generic action words, like "Combine" and work my way up to more specific words like, "disjoint".  Please take a look.  I can make any changes.

When there is agreement on these docstring changes, they should also be rolled into `union_all`, `disjoint_all`, `compose_all`

Thinking out loud...  Will need to:  - add key words to signature, while retaining `attrs` - add a deprecation warning in the, -- doc string -- functions. Code will trigger the warning when `attrs is not None` - Fix  the functions to use the keyword values, instead of `attrs`, when `attrs` is None -  add tests that  use keywords instead of `attrs`. These tests will work after `attrs` is dropped.

There is a strange bit in the examples for `node_link_data`. I'm not sure that I should carry it forward.  Here is a snippet.  ```     >>> data2 = json_graph.node_link_data(H, link="edges", source="from", target="to"})      To serialize with json      >>> s2 = json.dumps(     ...     data2, default={"link": "edges", "source": "from", "target": "to"}     ... ) ```  A dictionary of keywords is passed to `json.dumps` as keyword `default=`. But the documentation for `json.dumps` says that `default=` is a function, not a dictionary!   I tried the code. It runs, but the values in the default dict have no effect. Json ignores them.  Also, there are no examples in the tests of a default argument being passed to `json.dumps`.  Should I drop `default={"link": "edges", "source": "from", "target": "to"}` from the example code? Or does it have a purpose, that I am not seeing?  Thanks

Thanks for the feedback @dschult .   Yes, it makes sense to show the results. I can fix that up, and the namespace too.  I'm thinking that `node_link_graph` needs an example with JSON in it too.  And it needs to mention _Serialization_ in the description so someone can find it by that keyword.  I'll try something.  Note: There are question marks ("???") as placeholders in the doc string that need to be replaced with the version number of when the old signature will be removed.

Just did an update to the PR.   Here is a synopsis. Any feedback is welcome.  - The namespace is now nx. - The examples show the results - There are more examples with JSON loads and dumps - The short description for node_link_graph now refers to Serialization - There is a new note explaining that the keyword values must match between `node_link_data` and `node_link_graph` when converting back and forth between data and graphs.  The version number for dropping the deprecated signature is still needed.
