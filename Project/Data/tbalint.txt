issue
add Directed Joint Degree Graph generator#TITLE_END#Hi,  I would like to contribute the directed_joint_degree_graph function (similar to the undirected joint_degree_graph function). This graph generator is based my peer-reviewed publication with my co-authors:  B. Tillman, A. Markopoulou, C.T Butts, M.Gjoka, “[Construction of Directed 2K Graphs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3097983.3098119)”, in Proc. of KDD 2017. [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07340).  The main function, directed_joint_degree_graph, generates random graphs with input in/out degree sequences and directed joint degree correlation. I have included tests for checking inputs and the main function. I have followed the guidelines and other graph generators for my code.   Please let me know if you have any comments or see any issue!  Best, Balint
