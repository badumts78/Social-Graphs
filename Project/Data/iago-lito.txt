Distinguish between parallel cycles in a MultiDiGraph#TITLE_END#With the following multiple directed graph:  ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.MultiDiGraph() G.add_edge('a', 'b', data="red") G.add_edge('a', 'b', data="green") G.add_edge('b', 'a', data="blue")  for cycle in nx.simple_cycles(G):     print(cycle) ```  I get the output ``` ['b', 'a'] ```  I agree that this is correct.   However, I picked a MultiDiGraph because I want to allow parallel edges, and I am interested in the various cycling successions of *edges* in the graph. In my view, `G` contains not 1 but 2 parallel simple cycles, and I would expect more information about those. For instance:  ``` [(('a', 'b'), {'data': 'red'}), (('b', 'a'), {'data': 'blue'})] [(('a', 'b'), {'data': 'green'}), (('b', 'a'), {'data': 'blue'})] ``` I understand that this would break consistency with traditional calls to `nx.simple_cycles`. But I still believe that it is legitimate to expect this kind of information in the case of a `MultiDiGraph`.  How can I retrieve the information about various *edges* in the cycles, and distinguish between parallel cycles?   Have I missed another dedicated function for it?   Should I retrieve this information by other means, and offer this as a feature request instead?    Anyway, thank you for support and for networkx :)
