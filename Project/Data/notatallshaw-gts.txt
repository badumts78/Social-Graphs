FYI, for anyone who wants to suppress the warning (pollutes some CI pipelines I run), you can do the following:  ```python import warnings  with warnings.catch_warnings():     warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="networkx backend defined more than once: nx-loopback")     import networkx as nx ```
