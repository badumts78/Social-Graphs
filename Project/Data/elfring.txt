Increase the usage of augmented assignment statements#TITLE_END#:eyes: Some source code analysis tools can help to find opportunities for improving software components. :thought_balloon: I propose to [increase the usage of augmented assignment statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements "Augmented assignment statements") accordingly.  Would you like to integrate anything from a transformation result which can be generated by a command like the following? (:point_right: Please check also for questionable change suggestions because of an evolving search pattern.) ``` [Markus_Elfring@fedora lokal]$ perl -p -i.orig -0777 -e 's/^(?<indentation>\s+)(?<target>\S+)\s*=\s*\k<target>\s*(?<operator>[+\-%&|^@]|\*\*?|\/\/?|<<|>>)/$+{indentation}$+{target} $+{operator}=/gm' $(find ~/Projekte/networkx/lokal -name '*.py') ```
