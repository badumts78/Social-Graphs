issue
Fix simrank_similarity with directed graph input#TITLE_END#User @Carghaez pointed out the SimRank function is not behaving properly in [Issue 3953](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3953).  It appears the algorithm was trying to iterate over out-neighbor pairs.  On the [top of page 540 of the original paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/775047.775126) it says the algorithm should iterate over in-neighbor pairs.  This fix is performed by changing `G[<node>]` to `G.predecessors(<node>)`.  **Note to maintainers:** I had to change several tests after the fix.  A cycle graph using `DiGraph` works, but it gives trivial results since no nodes have common nodes pointing to them.  For a non-trivial choice, I chose to go with the implementation in the paper (the same one @Carghaez used in the issue he raised).  The `expected` strings match results from both the numbers in the paper and the `simrank_similarity_numpy` function.  **Disclaimer**: I just learned about SimRank today and am by no means an expert, so please review this change with a critical eye.

comment
@Carghaez, I am new to SimRank, but my understanding is it is only defined for directed graphs.  If that is correct, would it be better to replace line  ``` return importance_factor * avg_sim(list(product(G[u], G[v]))) ``` with ``` raise NetworkXAlgorithmError("SimRank requires a directed  graph.") ``` or some other explicit failure?
comment
@Carghaez Thank you for this fix.  I pulled it into https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3961 and restored the tests per the request from the maintainers.  I'm interested in learning more about applying SimRank to undirected graphs.  I only see applications for directed graphs in the paper referenced in the NetworkX docs.  Do you have a paper you recommend where I can learn more about this?
comment
I think it might be very verbose to unambiguously define the graph with `__repr__`.  Would it serve better to give classes a human-readable `__str__` instead?
comment
I took a look at this and was able to reproduce the problem.  I opened [a PR](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3961) proposing a fix.
