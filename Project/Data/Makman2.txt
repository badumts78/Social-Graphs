weakly_connected_components: Editing yielded sets during iteration has buggy side effects#TITLE_END#When modifying the yielded component sets during iteration from `weakly_connected_components`, strange things happen:  ```python import networkx as nx g = nx.MultiDiGraph()  g.add_edge(0, 1)                                                                       g.add_edge(1, 0)                                                                       g.add_edge(0, 3)                                                                       g.add_edge(0, 3)                                                                        print('Okay:') print(list(nx.weakly_connected_components(g))) # Everything alright, gives: [{0, 1, 3}]  print('Still okay:') for n in nx.weakly_connected_components(g):     print(n)     n.remove(0) # Will print once: {0, 1, 3}  print('NOT okay:') # Deleting the wrong node during the iteration: for n in nx.weakly_connected_components(g):     print(n)     n.remove(1) # Will print the set twice: # {0, 1, 3} # {0, 1, 3} ```  In case this is actually desired (which I doubt), that should be at least documented that the connected component set is not to be edited.

Add option to `in_edges` and `out_edges` to include edge key in the results#TITLE_END#Similar to `graph.edges(key=True)` :smile:  I currently use the keys themselves to store my relevant data (I want to make use of the automatic uniqueness by employing keys instead of the data-dict).
