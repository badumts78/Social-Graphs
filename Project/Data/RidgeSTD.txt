issue
Add node,edge data to line_graph()#TITLE_END#When I tried to get edge_induced isomorphic, I need to both convert MultiDiGraph into line_graph and carry data on the edge. However, when the code at `line.py`, line 127 executes, like this:  ``` if G.is_multigraph():         def get_edges(nbunch=None):             return G.edges_iter(nbunch, keys=True) ```  it doesn't give the `data` parameter, which erases all data on the edge.  I think maybe this is a consideration of efficiency, but at least should it be optional?  Just want to discuss the necessity of it!  ==========   second edit    ========== I tried to change `line.py` into this:  line 123:  ``` def _edge_func(G):     """Returns the edges from G, handling keys for multigraphs as necessary.      """     if G.is_multigraph():         def get_edges(nbunch=None):             return G.edges_iter(nbunch, keys=True, data=True)     else:         def get_edges(nbunch=None):             return G.edges_iter(nbunch)     return get_edges ```  line 148:  ``` def _lg_directed(G, create_using=None): if create_using is None:         L = G.__class__()     else:         L = create_using      # Create a graph specific edge function.     get_edges = _edge_func(G)      for from_node in get_edges():         # from_node is: (u,v) or (u,v,key)         L.add_node((from_node[0], from_node[1], from_node[2]), attr_dict=from_node[3])         for to_node in get_edges(from_node[1]):             L.add_edge((from_node[0], from_node[1], from_node[2]), (to_node[0], to_node[1], to_node[2]),)      return L ```  **Maybe** this would make it? After all, the edge-induced isomorphic works fine in my project just now.
