issue
Missing function nx.graphviz_layout, nx.drawing.graphviz_layout#TITLE_END#Hello!  I was trying to follow [this example](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11484144/224254) from StackOverflow to draw a tree, but the function `nx.graphviz_layout` appears to be gone. No problem, I thought, it looks like there is a more direct method now, `nx.draw_graphviz`. However, that function _also_ has trouble locating `nx.drawing.graphviz_layout`! Is this a bug or am I just doing it wrong?  ``` python >>> import networkx as nx >>> nx.draw_graphviz(t, prog='dot') ```  Results in:  ``` pytb --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-25-f112875cf9af> in <module>() ----> 1 nx.draw_graphviz(t, prog='dot')  /groups/saalfeld/home/nuneziglesiasj/conda/envs/gala/lib/python3.5/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py in draw_graphviz(G, prog, **kwargs)     982        See networkx.draw_networkx() for a description of optional keywords.     983     """ --> 984     pos = nx.drawing.graphviz_layout(G, prog)     985     draw(G, pos, **kwargs)     986   AttributeError: module 'networkx.drawing' has no attribute 'graphviz_layout' ```  I'm using version 1.11, installed with conda.  ``` python >>> nx.__version__ '1.11' ```

Finding ancestors and descendants in DAGs#TITLE_END#Hi Aric,  I've added two functions in algorithms for directed acyclic graphs, `ancestors` and `descendants`. They find all nodes from which you can reach `source`, and all nodes reachable from `source`, respectively.  In addition, I did a bit of renaming in BFS, since you are actually using a queue, not a stack. (I'm guessing the "stack" name carried over from DFS.)  Juan.
