assortativity on vectors #TITLE_END#Hello,  When I try to run `nx.numeric_assortativity_coefficient` on a node feature which is a numpy array (or list) of floats I receive     `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/assortativity/mixing.py", line 188, in numeric_mixing_matrix     d=attribute_mixing_dict(G,attribute,nodes)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/assortativity/mixing.py", line 52, in attribute_mixing_dict     return mixing_dict(xy_iter,normalized=normalized)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/assortativity/mixing.py", line 221, in mixing_dict     if x not in d: TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'`  Is this feature supported?
