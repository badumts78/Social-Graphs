Strange behaviour with setting edge_attributes in nx.from_pandas_edgelist#TITLE_END#Hi!  I am encountering strange behaviour in assigning weights when creating an undirected graph using `nx.from_pandas_edgelist` - I am not sure if this is a bug, but would appreciate some clarification on this!  I have a pandas edgelist which looks as follows:  ``` source | target | value -- | -- | -- node1 | node2 | 0.855247 node1 | node3 | 0.883058 node1 | node4 | 0.878212 etc ``` now when i do:` graph = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, edge_attr=True).to_undirected()`, this works fine and i can also called communities using the community-louvain tool - `community.best_partition(graph)`  however: if i rename the value column in the edgelist to weights as follows:  ``` source | target | weights -- | -- | -- node1 | node2 | 0.855247 node1 | node3 | 0.883058 node1 | node4 | 0.878212 etc ``` and then do: `graph = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, edge_attr='weights').to_undirected()` The function works, but there is something funny about the weight assignment as I get an error in community detection:  `community.best_partition(graph)` - ValueError: Bad node degree (-0.7013372005704317)  My specific question isn't about the community tool - but why renaming the value column to weights and the specifying this column in the graph function messes the weight assignment and then other things downstream.   thank you!

Repelling nodes based on colors in bigger graph generated from smaller graphs#TITLE_END#Hi all,   I have generated a graph based on edges in several smaller undirected graphs. The graphs are composed of nodes that are features from aging (so each individual smaller graph is one age). What i would like to see is the transition of edges from one age to another and how communities of features change over time. The bigger graph is generated as follows:  ```  g=nx.MultiGraph() g.add_edges_from(graphAge1.edges(data=True)) g.add_edges_from(graphAge2.edges(data=True)) g.add_edges_from(graphAge3.edges(data=True))  g.add_nodes_from(graphAge1.nodes()) ``` etc...  nodes are colored so that any node that is common between all graphs is white and if not it is blue.  edges are colored such that the edge color represents the age it comes from: A graph composed of edges from three ages produces the following:  <img width="792" alt="Screenshot 2020-08-10 at 12 57 02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33659783/89780449-5ece7a00-db09-11ea-8b34-7efe5884dd78.png">  if you look at the the community densely populated by red edges, there are also yellow edges present, however the density of nodes from the red age make it difficult to see! Is there any way that that these nodes can be repelled from one another further so that the yellow and red ages are clearly visible (but without disrupting the community, as these communites tell me which features nodes are connected to at one age and how they change and disband in to certain features are later ages)  Any advice would be much appreciated! Unless there is a better way to construct a big graph from smaller ones and visualise transitions of communities over time?  thanks!

Labelling nodes as communities they belong not to showing in plot -- stays as default nodes name#TITLE_END#Hi all,   I am not sure if this is a bug and might be more appropriate for stack overflow, but going to post here in case its an issue.   I have generated a nx.Graph which works fine, and then found communities in the graph as follows:  ``` networkGraph12=nx.Graph(corr12).to_undirected()  #remove weights < than threshold edge_weights = nx.get_edge_attributes(networkGraph14,'weight') networkGraph14.remove_edges_from((e for e, w in edge_weights.items() if w <0.8))  #remove non-connected vertices for component in list(nx.connected_components(networkGraph14)):     if len(component)<2:         for node in component:             networkGraph14.remove_node(node)  #community detection import community partition = community.best_partition(networkGraph12)   #plot based on communities of gene-expression plt.rcParams.update(plt.rcParamsDefault) plt.rcParams.update({'figure.figsize': (15, 10)}) plt.style.use('dark_background')  #fig,ax=plt.subplots() #ax.set_facecolor("white") pos=nx.fruchterman_reingold_layout(networkGraph14, seed=50)  #plot graph nx.draw_networkx(     networkGraph14,     cmap = plt.get_cmap("rainbow"),      node_color = list(parts14.values()),     pos=pos,      node_size=5,     edge_color='silver',     alpha=0.4,      with_labels=False     ) plt.show() ``` This produce Graph attached to this post. It works perfectly and the community detection itself makes perfect sense in terms of the nodes that cluster together.   However i am trying to label the nodes by the communities to which they belong, as oppose to the node names themselves which are fairly long-ish words, so rendering them on the plot is pointless... this isn't the only reason i want to change the labelling... i really want to know which communities in the plot actually are -- i.e, which community in the plot is community 1, etc.. when i run this code: ```  nx.draw_networkx(     networkGraph14,     cmap = plt.get_cmap("rainbow"),      node_color = list(parts14.values()),     pos=pos,      node_size=5,     edge_color='silver',     alpha=0.4,      with_labels=True,     labels=list(parts14.values()),     font_color='white'     ) plt.show() ``` This code works, but the node labels as a result of this code are still the original node names and not the community number  ... is this a bug? is there a way of at least identifying which communities each color belong to?  sorry if this is more suited to stack..  thanks!  ![p3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33659783/85011902-1ecac680-b15a-11ea-841c-5abcf58108f8.png)
