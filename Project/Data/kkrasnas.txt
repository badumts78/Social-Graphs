issue
maximum_independent_set approximation returns incorrect results#TITLE_END#The **[maximum_independent_set](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.approximation.independent_set.maximum_independent_set.html#networkx.algorithms.approximation.independent_set.maximum_independent_set)** method is supposed to return maximum out of all independent sets generated in the algorithm, i.e. **the biggest set of the list of sets**. What it actually does is call `max(list_of_sets)` in the end, which will not give us the largest set. For example, try to run this code: ``` list_of_sets = [{456}, {200, 390, 10}, {1200, 200}] print "Max value element : ", max(list_of_sets) ``` To fix this it's enough to change it to` max(list_of_sets, key=len)`.  Same thing with max_clique, since they are using the same underlying method. I am using latest release 1.11 with python 2.7.  Maybe such ticket already exists, but I couldn't find it.
