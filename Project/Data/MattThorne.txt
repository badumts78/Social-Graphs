Clausets local community detection algorithm#TITLE_END#This PR adds Clauset’s original local community detection (LCD) algorithm. The algorithm enables identification of communities starting from a source node, using a greedy expansion approach based on local modularity optimisation.  This method is particularly advantageous when: - The complete graph is unknown or only partially observable. - The graph is too large for global community detection methods to be computationally feasible.  The algorithm is efficient for discovering localized communities without requiring access to global network information, making it useful for applications such as web crawling, social network analysis, or large-scale graph exploration.  There are many LCD algorithms, but Clausets original algorithm will be a good place to start including LCD into NetworkX   ### References  - The original paper by Clauset (2005) can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0503036). - For a broader introduction to local community detection, see [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3213980).
