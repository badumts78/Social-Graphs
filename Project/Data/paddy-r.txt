issue
Possible issue with optimal_edit_paths#TITLE_END#I've been using ```optimal_edit_paths``` for tree reconciliation but it takes ~10 minutes when the number of edits is quite small (specifically, it seems to be substitutions that cause the slow-down, rather than deletions and additions).  I've added more details in a question at Stack Overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62451684/problems-with-networkx-optimal-edit-paths-graph-edit-distance). As I say there, I'm absolutely not suggesting there's a bug, but my question is whether very slow resolution of the edit paths is to be expected (computationally speaking) for even a small number of edits, as this would make the method unusable for me!
