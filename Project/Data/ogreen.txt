K-truss is defined for edges belonging to (k-2) triangles and not for k triangles#TITLE_END#NX is pruning edges incorrectly for k-truss. Specifically, NX is pruning edges that belong to fewer than k triangles. The correct definition is to remove edges that belong to fewer than (k-2) triangles. As such. NX is pruning edges in an aggressive manner. The following links point to several verified sources that have the definition of k-truss (including the original paper by J. Cohen). - https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.505.7006&rep=rep1&type=pdf  (page 6) - https://graphchallenge.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/SubGraphChallenge-2017-02-09.pdf - https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.505.7006&rep=rep1&type=pdf (page 2 on the bottom right)  This PR also fixes the problem.

Katz centrality is not being initialized correctly. Especially problematic if beta=0.#TITLE_END# By default the array X is set to value zero in Line 157: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/centrality/katz.py#L157  Now if beta is set to zero (which is a valid value for Katz, especially if a closer estimation to the actual Katz score is desirable), then the following computation in Line 176 and Line 178 results in all zeros: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/centrality/katz.py#L176.  There are two viable solutions for overcoming this problem. Both involve updating:  x = dict([(n, 0) for n in G]) to either:  x = dict([(n, beta) for n in G]) or  x = dict([(n, 1.0) for n in G])
