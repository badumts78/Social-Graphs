issue
incorrect plot labels for Unicode nodes#TITLE_END#Hello, I've found an issue. When nodes are Unicode string Matplotlib shows labels in incorrect way.  As far as I understand the problem in draw_networkx_labels(...) in nx_pylab.py. After unpacking  from dictionary string become an nonunicode.   For represent bug use this code:  ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6401696/37168052-53480be0-230c-11e8-9454-7913a9eee96a.png)   ``` # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  G=nx.Graph() G.add_edges_from( [(u"привет", u"мир")] ) nx.draw_kamada_kawai(G, with_labels = True)  plt.show() ```
