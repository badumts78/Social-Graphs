What is the status on this?   I have the same problem while trying to use all_pairs_dijkstra_path_length, and I think it is present in all the functions from shortest_path. It basically makes weighted MultiGraphs unusable..   Is there a plan? I could help to fix this

I can explain my problem better: I was using a DiGraph on which I performed a shortest_path using a weight function `wt(u,v,datadict)`. As the weight of the edges depended on some data which was shared between some of the edges, i did not save this in the graph object itself, in order to save quite some memory. in the weight function then i process the `(u,v)` tuple to fetch the data I need from the external dict to compute the weight.  I am now switching to a MultiDiGraph, and the previous process is not possible anymore as the `wt(u,v,datadict)` doesn't know which edge is being processed (we don't have access to the key).   I feel like with MultiGraphs, `(u,v,key)` should be passed to `wt` instead of just `(u,v)`. I feel like these kind of problems are related to the discussion about typing. I think Edge objects should be passed, and what that actually is depends on the case.  Do you see any solution other than saving all the data on the edges (that would require quite some memory)?
