Mixed negative and positive values for Katz centrality#TITLE_END#Recently, while using networkx, I computed Katz centrality on a network using the default values and no edge weighting. The results showed a mix of negative and positive values for this metric which I believe should always be positive (or in some circumstances always negative). Please see this link: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/igraph-help/2009-10/msg00059.html  I believe the cause of this may be that for this network the default value for alpha was not less than the inverse of the largest eigenvalue for the Adjacency matrix (please see here: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.katz_centrality.html). Does this sound correct?  If that is correct, is it possible to add a check to see whether this condition is satisfied rather than to return erroneous numbers?

Error on using approximation for Betweenness#TITLE_END#When entering an integer for k in the calculation of betweenness I receive the following error message:  ``` File "/home/andrew/miniconda3/envs/polinode-metrics/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/centrality/betweenness.py", line 112, in betweenness_centrality     nodes = random.sample(G.nodes(), k)   File "/home/andrew/miniconda3/envs/polinode-metrics/lib/python3.4/random.py", line 311, in sample     raise TypeError("Population must be a sequence or set.  For dicts, use list(d).") TypeError: Population must be a sequence or set.  For dicts, use list(d). ```  Any thoughts? It would seem that random.sample requires G.nodes( ) be wrapped in a list( ). 
comment
Are there any constraints for this algorithm? I've read the paper and intuitively it would seem not (e.g. self-loops should be OK).  But...when I try to run it on some data it doesn't return for some graphs. It's OK for trivial graphs but I've tried on a couple with a few hundred edges and it doesn't return after a few minutes. Any idea as to expected run time / constraints would be appreciated.
