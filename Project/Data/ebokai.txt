Condition in `test_louvain::test_threshold` not representative of graphs with same parameters but different seed.#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  ``` def test_threshold():     G = nx.LFR_benchmark_graph(         250, 3, 1.5, 0.009, average_degree=5, min_community=20, seed=10     )     partition1 = nx.community.louvain_communities(G, threshold=0.3, seed=2)     partition2 = nx.community.louvain_communities(G, seed=2)     mod1 = nx.community.modularity(G, partition1)     mod2 = nx.community.modularity(G, partition2)      assert mod1 < mod2 ``` The test for the Louvain algorithm asserts if the modularity of a partition obtained using `threshold=0.3` is smaller than the modularity  when using the default value for a specific graph generated using the `LFR_benchmark_graph`. However, if the graph used for testing is changed, this condition no longer holds in general (see Steps to Reproduce).   ### Expected Behavior  I suggest changing the test to `assert mod1 <= mod2` instead.   ### Steps to Reproduce  If we use the same settings for the graph generation but allow for a different seed we do not always pass the assertion.  ``` generating = True tries = 0 while generating:     seed = np.random.randint(50000)      try:         G = nx.LFR_benchmark_graph(250, 3, 1.5, 0.009, average_degree = 5, min_community = 20, seed = seed)         print(f'generated graph {seed}')         generating = False     except:         tries += 1 print(tries)  check = 0 for i in range(100):     random_seed = np.random.randint(50000)     p1 = nx.community.louvain_communities(G, threshold = 0.3, seed = random_seed)     p2 = nx.community.louvain_communities(G, seed = random_seed)     m1 = nx.community.modularity(G, p1)     m2 = nx.community.modularity(G, p2)     print(m1, m2)     if m1 < m2:         check += 1 print(check) ```  On my machine, it took 28 tries to generate a graph (seed = 26537). For this graph, the test was successful 83/100 times. If we relax the test condition to `assert m1 <= m2` the test succeeds 100/100 times.  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 3.1
