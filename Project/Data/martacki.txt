modulartiy_max: introduce enforce_n_communities parameter#TITLE_END#In modularity_max, I introduced the additional parameter ``n_communitites`` in  #4950. However, for my application I want to sometimes go below the optimal community structure and continue the merging process until n_communities is reached, regardless if this does not further improve modulartiy. In that case I'd want to merge those nodes that decrease modularity the least. I propose a solution to solve this issue in this PR.  2 other options to implement this without the `enforce_n_communities` parameter: 1. Always proceed this way if n_communities is not 1. This has downside when n_communities indeed should be 1, but optimal modularity is archieved for a larger network. This is common in my application, but theoretically could be circumvent in the specific use-case. (don't like this option) 2. n_communities is `None` by default, and if given, the number of communities is always enforced (i.e. also if n_communities=1; might be nicer than current suggestion).

modularity_max: breaking the loop when given community size is reached#TITLE_END#Hi; a small suggestion to allow breaking the greedy_modularity_max loop when a certain number of communities is reached. Nothing changes when using the default configuration, i.e. if the parameter is not specified... Would help for my work!

modularity_max: account for edge weights#TITLE_END#Unfortunately I couldn't find a related issue or PR, so here's my suggestion to account for the edge weights.
