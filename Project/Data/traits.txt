issue
gml writing and customized label text#TITLE_END#Currently I  learned the hard way, that for gml output visible text for a node label cannot be changed by setting the `"label"` attribute or any other means. Documentation mentions somewhere, that `"id"` _and_ `"label"` are maintained by networkx and in fact, a user-defined `"label"` entry will be overwritten from `write_gml`. This seems wrong to me, because - as far as I can see - networkx ensures uniqueness yet by controlling `"id"` and this would be sufficient, in my opinion.  There should be IMO a difference between a nodes identity and his visual representation. For yEd I'm able to set some `LabelGraphics{"text"}` attribute and the program will show this text instead of `"label"`. But this is not portable, cytoscape for example will not respect this tag. Would it be possible, to change this?   BTW, does someone know about a comprehensive GML format reference. All I can find is some obscure archived version of the original proposal (incomplete) and some outdated - but more comprehensive - information on [yEd's home page](https://docs.yworks.com/yfiles/doc/developers-guide/gml.html) .
