Add test Kernighan Lin Algorithm#TITLE_END#This is a proposal to fix issue #4415 . I added a test which calls kernighan_lin_bisection() with max_iter argument set to 1.   Since the test case is a simple situation, the algorithm finds the minimal cut at first iteration. Before issue #4398 was fixed, the test I wrote would fail because loop on line 130 on kernighan_lin_bisection only maxe one swap ( the _kernighan_lin_sweep function was always returning 0 in second position).   The test case I used can be found on page 7 here : http://users.ece.northwestern.edu/~haizhou/357/lec2.pdf  NB: This is my first time contributing so I would happy to have any feedbacks.

Enhancement intersection function 3265#TITLE_END#This is a proposition to fix issue #3265 - Enhancement for the intersection of two graphs.   The code does not raise a Value Error anymore when we try to intersect two graphs that don't have the same node sets. It now returns a graph which contains all the nodes that are the intersection of the two node sets and edges that are the intersection of the two edge sets.  I added a few tests and modified those which where expecting an error when running intersection function for two different node sets. I updated documentation accordingly.  
comment
I made a test using max_iter argument to reveal the bug fixed by #4398  With only one iteration, the algorithm is able to find the minimal cut. Because of that bug on line 130 in kernighan_lin_bisection all the necessary swaps will not happen on first iteration and the result is not satisfying
