digraph documentation says attributes are stored in a dictionary#TITLE_END#[Maybe there are multiple digraph packages floating around out there, and I'm confused about which one I'm using.  But otherwise...]  https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/digraph.html "Each graph, node, and edge can hold key/value attribute pairs in an associated attribute dictionary"  The documentation states that attributes are stored in a dictionary.  They aren't; they are stored as a list of key,value 2-tuples.  The documentation should accurately reflect the implementation so as to not confuse the reader.  However, the implementation is confusing and non-intuitive.  In python, when you iterate through the attributes on an object, you do not get multiple key,value pairs that have the same key.  And you can index into the attributes on an object using dictionary syntax.  If the implementation implemented a dictionary, that would be intuitive.  If the implementation insists on using a different data structure than we commonly use all the time in python, then it shouldn't call that data structure "attributes".
