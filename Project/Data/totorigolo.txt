transitive_reduction loses node data#TITLE_END#Hi!  I'm using `networkx` for small dependency graphs, and I'm especially interested in the transitive_reduction algorithm. However, I noticed that all nodes lose their associated data after using this algorithm. Is that the expected behavior?  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/fedc37f8cb342b2f630f7bbd080ebe076a3217e9/networkx/algorithms/dag.py#L546  I made a quickfix locally by just replacing by this: ```python3 TR.add_nodes_from(G.nodes.items()) ```  Do you want a PR?  --- Somehow related, `transitive_reduction` creates a new OrderedGraph with:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/fedc37f8cb342b2f630f7bbd080ebe076a3217e9/networkx/algorithms/dag.py#L545  Shouldn't that be something like `TR = type(G)()` instead (modulo good Python practices)? I'm using `OrderedDiGraph`s because I want determinism with Python 3.4+.
