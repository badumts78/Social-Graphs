Fix `is_aperiodic`#TITLE_END#The current implementation of `is_aperiodic` ([link](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.dag.is_aperiodic.html#networkx.algorithms.dag.is_aperiodic)) is incorrect. It short-circuits when `g != 1` with return value `False`. However, `g != 1` for the currently explored nodes doesn't necessarily mean the graph is not aperiodic.  One of the current tests is incorrect (`G` contains a self-loop and is therefore aperiodic. But the test claims that it is not aperiodic):  ```python def test_is_aperiodic_disconnected2():     G = nx.DiGraph()     nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 1, 2])     G.add_edge(3, 3)     assert not nx.is_aperiodic(G) ```  Several tests that fail with the current implementation are added. Preview:  ```python def test_is_aperiodic_cycle5():     G = nx.DiGraph()     nx.add_cycle(G, [1, 2, 3, 4])     nx.add_cycle(G, [5, 6, 7])     G.add_edge(5, 1)     assert nx.is_aperiodic(G)   def test_is_aperiodic_acyclic_component():     G = nx.DiGraph()     G.add_node(0)     G.add_edge(1, 1)     assert nx.is_aperiodic(G)   def test_is_aperiodic_acyclic_component2():     G = nx.DiGraph()     G.add_node(0)     nx.add_cycle(G, [1, 2, 3])     nx.add_cycle(G, [2, 3, 4, 5])     assert nx.is_aperiodic(G) ```  The fixed new implementation works in the same manner as the original one, but is no longer recursive.

Fix `min_weight_matching`#TITLE_END#The current `min_weight_matching` claims to compute a minimum-weight maximal matching, but it is actually computing a minimum-weighted maximum-cardinality matching.  The minimum-weight maximal matching, which it claims to solve, is NP-hard. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08506):  > As we know since 1961, all natural variants of perfect matchings and maximum matchings can be found in polynomial time, even in general graphs. Here we study a different problem — Minimum Maximal Matching (MMM). The task is — given graph G, to find an inclusion-wise maximal matching M with the smallest cardinality (or weight in the weighted version). > > The MMM problem was studied as early as 1980, when Yannakakis and Gavril showed, that it is NP-hard even in some restricted cases.  Changes include:  - Corrected the docstring description to fit the function behavior - Removed an incorrect test, which mistakenly tried to set `maxcardinality` (the min version does not have such a keyword parameter) - Added a test to show that we are computing a minimum-weighted maximum-cardinality matching instead of a minimum-weight maximal matching

A minimal fix for `is_aperiodic`#TITLE_END#This is a minimal fix for `is_aperiodic`. See #8021 .  Description: The original logic of `is_aperiodic` can be used to calculate period of a graph, so it is moved to `_period`, with an extra check to make sure it do not go outside the current strongly connected component. `is_aperiodic` now simply returns `_period(G) == 1`.

Fix typos for `strongly_connected_components`#TITLE_END#Variable `queue` and `scc_queue` in `strongly_connected_components` are actually stacks.
