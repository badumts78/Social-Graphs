Allow multiple cutoffs for all_simple_paths#TITLE_END#Allow limiting the results of `nx.all_simple_paths` not only by the length of the path but as well as by other `weight` attributes.

Limit all_simple_paths by weight#TITLE_END#This a first effort to allow limiting the results of `nx.all_simple_paths` not only by the length of the path but as well as by the distance covered as specified by the `weight` attribute. The suggested approach is most likely inefficient but it could work as a basis for further improvement.
