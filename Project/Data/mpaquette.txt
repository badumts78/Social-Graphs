rich_club_coefficient is wrong when the highest degree nodes aren't connected#TITLE_END#The rich club coefficient (not normalized) for un-weighted, un-directed graphs is the ratio between the number of edges between nodes of degree greater than k (E[k]) and the maximum possible number of such edges (N[k] nodes of degree greater than k gives N[k]*(N[k]-1) / 2 possible edges).  If your biggest hubs aren't connected together, as you iterate up in k, you get to a point where E[k] is zero and the rich-club should be 0 but nx.algorithms.richclub._compute_rc doesn't properly handle the boundary case and it's always 1, the same value you would expected with completely connected hubs.   ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.karate_club_graph() print sorted(G.degree().values())[-3:] # [12, 16, 17] print G.degree((0, 33)) # {0: 16, 33: 17} print (0, 33) in G.edges() # False rc = nx.rich_club_coefficient(G,normalized=False) print [rc[i] for i in range(12, 16)] # [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] G.add_edge(0, 33) rc = nx.rich_club_coefficient(G,normalized=False) print [rc[i] for i in range(12, 17)] # [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] ```
