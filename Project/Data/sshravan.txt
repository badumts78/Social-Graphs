issue
min_cost_flow does not throw an exception when the graph is disconnected#TITLE_END#According to the docs ([here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.flow.min_cost_flow.html)), `min_cost_flow` is supposed to throw an exception if the source vertex is not connected to destination vertex.  On the contrary, the following code is stuck in an infinite loop:  ``` G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_nodes_from(range(5), demand=0) G.node[4]['demand'] = -13 G.node[3]['demand'] = 13  edges = [ (0, 2, {'capacity': 20, 'weight': 0.1}), (0, 3, {'capacity': 20, 'weight': 0.1}), (2, 1, {'capacity': 20, 'weight': 0.1})] G.add_edges_from(edges) flowDict = nx.min_cost_flow(G) ```  Is this a bug? I am using version 2.1
