Overhead in reverse function?#TITLE_END#I have the following code  ``` import networkx  def reverse_graph(g):     reversed = networkx.DiGraph()     for e in g.edges():         reversed.add_edge(e[1], e[0])     return reversed   g = networkx.DiGraph()  for i in range(500000):     g.add_edge(i, i+1)  g3 = reverse_graph(g) g2 = g.reverse() ```  And my line profiler says that `networkx.reverse` implementation takes about 20 seconds where as mine takes about 7.  What I don't understand is what's happening under the hood here.  Why does the `networkx` implementation take so much longer
