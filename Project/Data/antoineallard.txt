Adding onion decomposition#TITLE_END#The onion decomposition refines the k-core decomposition by providing information on the internal organization of each shell. This is a relatively new tool from network science, but I'm being increasingly more asked for the code and I thought the community might appreciate having it well integrated in networkx.  The extraction code takes the form of a single function which has been added to the `core` submodule (`algorithms/core.py`); its natural home in my opinion.  I added a test function to `algorithms/tests/test_core.py` which is similar to the one for the function `core_number`.  This is my first contribution to networkx; any feedback will be greatly appreciated.
