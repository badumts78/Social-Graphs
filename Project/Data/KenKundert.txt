issue
cycle_basis, so close#TITLE_END#I was very excited when I found cycle_basis() because it seemed to be exactly what I wanted. I am analyzing circuits and I needed the fundamental loops of the circuit's graph. Then I discovered two issues. First, it only works with Graph and not MultiGraph, and in general circuits have parallel edges and so require MultiGraph. Second, cycle_basis() returns the nodes of the loop rather than the edges, and I need the edges. If it were a Graph, I guess I could derive the edges from the nodes, but that seems like a tedious process, and is much more tricky when using a MultiGraph.  These issues seem to dramatically reduce the usefulness of cycle_basis() in its stated area of applicability, so I am thinking I am missing something important. This would not be surprising since I am new to NetworkX. If that is the case, could you point me in the right direction?
