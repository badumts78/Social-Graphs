issue
`.number_of_edges()` method returns only zero when calling it inside a child class of `nx.Graph`#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  Hi maintainers, I'm using `networkx` and wish to define a child class of `nx.Graph()` and use it on my own algorithms. I wrote the `self.__init__` method for the child class like this: ```{python} 	def __init__(self, incoming_graph_data = None, **attr): 		super().__init__(incoming_graph_data, **attr) 		self.num_edges = self.number_of_edges() ``` and I expect the `self.num_edges` should be the actual number of edges in this graph. However it turns out to be 0 all the time.  ### Expected Behavior  `self.num_edges` should be the number of edges in the graph, instead of 0.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` import networkx as nx  class child_graph(nx.Graph):     def __init__(self, incoming_graph_data = None, **attr):         super().__init__(incoming_graph_data, **attr)         self.num_edges = self.number_of_edges() 		 if __name__ == '__main__':     G = child_graph()     G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2)])     print('number of edges: ', G.num_edges)     print('number of edges: ', G.number_of_edges())     print('edges: ', G.edges()) ``` **output**: ``` number of edges:  0 number of edges:  2 edges:  [(0, 1), (1, 2)] ```  ### Environment  Python version: `Python 3.11.2` NetworkX version: `'3.0'`  ### Additional context  None.
