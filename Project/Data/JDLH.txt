"dispatch" decorator needs documentation for contributors and readers of code#TITLE_END# ### Current Behavior  Many of the NetworkX algorithm implementation functions are preceded by a decorator `@nx._dispatch` or variant. It is difficult for a person reading the algorithm, who just wants to understand how the Python code in the function behaves, to understand the behaviour of that decorator. How does it change the behaviour of the plain Python code in the function? How should the reader summarise in their mind the purpose of the "dispatch" decorator?  For example, a plain `@nx._dispatch` decorates [approximation algorithm `min_maximal_matching`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/1168afca385dab8cbda8be3aa479a22581e94988/networkx/algorithms/approximation/matching.py#L16C1-L18C52): ``` @nx._dispatch def min_maximal_matching(G):     r"""Returns the minimum maximal matching of G. ... ```  A `@nx._dispatch()` with kwarg decorates [algorithm `flow_hierarchy`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/1168afca385dab8cbda8be3aa479a22581e94988/networkx/algorithms/hierarchy.py#L9-L11) ``` @nx._dispatch(edge_attrs="weight") def flow_hierarchy(G, weight=None):     """Returns the flow hierarchy of a directed network. ... ``` ... and dozens more.  A reader might consult the NetworkX documentation for a summary of the "dispatch" decorator. But there is no mention of it in the [***Introduction*** section](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/introduction.html) or the [***Algorithms*** section](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html).   [Searching the docs for "dispatch"](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/search.html?q=dispatch) returns five results. Three of these are [Reference documentation for the name `_dispatch`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.utils.backends._dispatch.html#dispatch), which have zero(!) explanatory text. Two are [Release Notes for NetworkX 3.1](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/release/release_3.1.html) and [3.2](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/release/release_3.2.html), which only mention adding the decorator, but do not explain what it does.   The [module `utils/backends.py`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/1168afca385dab8cbda8be3aa479a22581e94988/networkx/utils/backends.py) has extensive text, but it is not aimed at the reader of functions decorated with "_dispatch", and it does not summarise the behaviour of the decorator for a reader of the algorithm function. Instead, it seems to be aimed at author of a backend package, explaining how the dispatching works. Part of the text seems aimed at maintainers of NetworkX test code.   The _name_ of the decorator makes the problem worse. The name `dispatch` reads like a verb in the imperative form: "Dispatch this thing!" That creates an expectation that the decorator performs an action, known as "dispatch", and changes the behaviour of Python code in the decorated function. However, in the common case where no backend is present, I believe the decorator has no effect. Thus the expectation set by the imperative verb is incorrect.  ### Expected Behavior  There should at least two improvements.   First, there should be documentation aimed at the person reading the code of algorithm functions, summarising the effect the decorator has on the behaviour of the Python code in the function. I suspect that this could be as simple as,   > 'The `@nx._dispatch` decorator allows other libraries to take over execution of calls to this function. We call those other libraries "backends". In the common case that there is no backend, then this decorator has no effect.'  This documentation should be placed in discoverable locations. It should be in the [Reference for the Utility `_dispatch`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.utils.backends._dispatch.html#dispatch). A simple sentence, and link to further information, should be in the function's docstring.   Second, the decorator should be renamed. It should be a noun phrase (perhaps with adjectives) describing the function's capability, rather than being a verb in imperative form. The function is capable of being taken over by a backend, so that calls to the function are handled by the backend. Thus the function is an interface of sorts. It is open to reuse. Possible decorator names could be like:  * `@open_interface` * `@resusable_entry_point` * `@standard_frontend_func`  Other documentation would also help, but gets beyond the scope of this issue. For instance, there should be an overview of the idea of "backends", and the relationship of NetworkX to those backends, as a top-level section in the documentation. There should be an explanation for the writer of an algorithm function of how to decorate the function. There should be an explanation for the writer of other packages of how to connect to NetworkX as a backend. (This partially exists, but not as a distinct section.)  ### Steps to Reproduce  This issue concerns documentation. Follow the links in the sections above to reproduce. There is no need to execute code.  ### Environment  Python version: not applicable NetworkX version: 3.2.1  ### Additional context  None.

Should the name remain prefixed with an underscore forever?  I know very little about backend dispatching in NetworkX, but I think I remember reading that they underscore prefix was to signal that this decorator being preliminary and in flux. If this change is "one last time", then maybe the name is no longer preliminary or in flux?

@rossbar I think "dispatchable" is an improvement on the previous name "dispatch". It has the advantage that, as you say, it reads like a property of the decorated function.  It has the disadvantage of being opaque to most readers about what that property actually means.  The word "dispatchable" does not by itself quite tell most readers what they need to know.   Thus I think the new name needs to be paired with an explanation of the decorator, under the name "dispatchable", in the function reference documentation. When I was looking for an explanation of this decorator, the function reference is where I searched for the name "_dispatch". There was no text under that heading. I suggest that the explanation include a message to readers who don't care about backends, and are not using networkx as a front end to other libraries, that this decorator is of no concern to them.  Then it should have a reference to the place in the documentation where dispatching and backends are explained.   Maybe after that it has the normal reference documentation about the decorator, its parameters, its effects, etc. A lot of this reference documentation is presently located in the [module utils/backends.py](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/1168afca385dab8cbda8be3aa479a22581e94988/networkx/utils/backends.py).
