AT-free graph recognition#TITLE_END#Dear all,  This is my first contribution to networkx and to any open-source project so bear with me. I have created a module called `asteroidal.py`which contains a method for recognition of AT-free graphs. I plan to implement more functionality for asteroidal recognition and some other graph recognitions which I have developed, but I try to keep my first pull request small.  ### What does the PR contain `asteroidal.py` implements the method `is_at_free` which takes a graph and checks whether it contains any asteroidal triples or not, i.e. if it is AT-free or not. AT-free graphs is a graph class for which several classical NP-complete problems are solvable polynomial time, independent set and coloring (even list coloring) amongst them.  ### Documentation I have tried to set up sphinx locally to check what my docstrings would look like, but have not been able yet. I'm particularly curious about the math codes.
