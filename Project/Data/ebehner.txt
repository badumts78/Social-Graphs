all_node_cuts returns incorrect cuts#TITLE_END#The function `all_node_cuts` returns node cut-sets for the K2 (complete graph with two nodes), but there exist no.  ### Current Behavior  Consider the following graph, consisting of two nodes connected by an edge: ```python graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_edge(1,2) list(all_node_cuts(graph) >>> [{1}, {2}] ``` This graph has no node cut-sets because removing any vertex does not increase the number of connected components  ### Expected Behavior  Return no node cut-sets: ```python graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_edge(1,2) list(all_node_cuts(graph) >>> [] ```  ### Steps to Reproduce  The above example  ### Environment  Python version: 3.10.10 NetworkX version: 2.6.3
