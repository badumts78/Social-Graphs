Thanks for tagging me.  I was only involved when the original unweighted algorithm was implemented; back then it was ported from my C++ implementation into python networkx. I remember we had an assert in there that made sure it was an unweighted graph; otherwise the user should simply not make use of `useBounds=true`. For the unweighted version we also had some well-thought-through testcases, if I remember correctly.  It is nice to see that there is now also a weighted version. I was not the person who implemented the weighted variant, nor can I say whether that algorithm is correct at this point.  Quickly judging the code, indeed setting the initial values to N is not enough, because there can be just one numeric edge weight greater than the number of nodes, and the whole thing does not work any more.  So, the suggested fix seems logical, and should not affect he unweighted case. Does this help?

The variables `maxlower` is the largest lower bound on the eccentricity for all nodes: the diameter is _at least_ equal to this value. The variable `maxupper` is the largest upper bound on the eccentricity for all nodes: the diameter is _at most_ equal to this value.  The variable `minupper` is not used for the diameter computation, it is meant for the radius computation. In short, I strongly recommend not to make this change. Let me know if I can elaborate further!

I am the author of that algorithm. Happy to answer questions.

I think the `compute='eccentricities'` is a remnant from the fact that the `extrema_bounding` function can in theory compute five different things: radius, diameter (what it is most used for), core size (defined as the the number of nodes with eccentricity equal to radius), periphery size (defined as the number of nodes with eccentricity equal to the diameter) and all eccentricities.  For each of these five, the main loop of the function works the same, but the loop has a different stopping criterion based on which of the five measures one wants to compute.

Thanks for entering this [patch](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/networkx-discuss/l5jfceWgc0g) as a pull request :)  I have reviewed the changes you made to my original patch, and it all seems fine to me. Indeed, everything is now a bit more "Pythonic" than my original code (which was based on an implementation in C++).

Thanks for your useful suggestions to make the code mode pythonic, @jtorrents ! As for your question w.r.t. line 96 of distance_measures.py; I added a reply inline. In short: yes, the int casting can be omitted.
