issue
KeyError in all_shortest_paths() with missing source node#TITLE_END#I use DiGraph with all_shortest_paths(). I was adding error path unit tests for my project, and I found that the all_shortest_paths() function will raise a KeyError instead of NetworkXError if the source node is not in the graph:  ``` python Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/pebenito/projects/setools/tests/infoflow.py", line 378, in test_932_all_shortest_paths_source_excluded     paths = list(a.all_shortest_paths("node1", "node2"))   File "/home/pebenito/projects/setools/setools/infoflow.py", line 211, in all_shortest_paths     for p in nx.all_shortest_paths(self.subG, s, t):   File "/usr/lib64/python3.3/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/generic.py", line 357, in all_shortest_paths     pred = nx.predecessor(G,source)   File "/usr/lib64/python3.3/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/unweighted.py", line 338, in predecessor     for w in G[v]:   File "/usr/lib64/python3.3/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py", line 319, in __getitem__     return self.adj[n] KeyError: <Type(<qpol_policy_t id=140070666001936>,"node1")> ```  I'm seeing this with NetworkX 1.9.1.

Remove sys.stdout.write() in Graph.nbunch_iter()/bunch_iter()#TITLE_END#This was probably an accidental commit after developing the error condition checking that follows. 
comment
I use shortest_path, all_shortest_paths, and all_simple_paths in my project. Shortest_path and all_simple_paths appear to raise NetworkXError if the source node doesn't exist and NetworkXNoPath if the target node doesn't exist. That inconsistency is probably a separate issue, but my suggestion is that both situations should raise Error (or UnknownNode, if you go down that road).
