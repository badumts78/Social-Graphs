Fix 1568: Pydot - GraphViz visualization for complex objects#TITLE_END#As reported in #1568, GraphViz breaks down when the nodes are complex python objects (especially when string representation of two nodes in the graph are same). See comments https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1568#issuecomment-341931155  ## After this fix: ![screen shot 2017-11-07 at 5 27 21 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1865964/32526982-fd0af06a-c3e0-11e7-9ad9-b64b3f7c94d7.png)   ## Without this fix: <img width="952" alt="screen shot 2017-11-04 at 3 42 53 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1865964/32527017-1f5d34de-c3e1-11e7-8110-b997a6d5f43d.png">   - Closes #1568  - Please merge this, or let me know if any changes are to be made. This is crucial for my use, otherwise I will have to keep track of 2 versions of networkx. - Tested on Python 3.6

Same issue here.  I am using my custom python class objects instead of strings for nodes. I believe I have correctly implemented `__hash__`, `__eq__`, `__repr__` and `__str__` methods. Two objects share the same `__str__` representation (the name that I want to put on the node) but the hash contents are different (eg: in a tree, the parent node is different).  The default set implementation recognizes that the objects are different (based on `__hash__`, `__eq__`) despite having same `__str__`.  So, I guess the node objects are explicitly converted to strings before adding to list/set/dict somewhere.  Trying to fix. Any pointers would be helpful.

Caught the bug. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/c01040c4f1f50bd036f76a0b26b30d0ad2130565/networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py#L319 The `make_str()` breaks the functionality for complex objects.   Suggestion: how about calling `hash(node)` for ID and `str(node)` for name??

Update:  Now I understand that the pydot.Node doesn't support such functionality.  It just takes `name` and thats all it does. Suggestion: extend `pydot.Node` to properly handle name and hashcode
