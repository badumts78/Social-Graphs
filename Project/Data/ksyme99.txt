Hi, we have a middle-man artifact tool (JFrog) which has a security scanner (Xray) which has blocked networkx due to this vulnerability. We have managed to get an exception added but it would be good to know timescales for a release to resolve to be able to remove the expcetion. My understanding from scanning all the related issues/PR is v2.6 should remove the vulnerability as PyYAML has been updated to remove the unsafe code (the offending function has different loader type, similar to this PR, from #4548). In a future v3 the whole thing is going to go as it is deprecated. Is there a timescale on v2.6 release?
