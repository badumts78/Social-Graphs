Weird results in average_neighbor_degree for directed graph#TITLE_END#Hi, I was looking at average_neighbor_degree method with directed graphs and I've got results that don't match with my intuition and my hand calculation.   My graph: ![digraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37271385/157540141-125f7746-9258-45ea-b215-7f1c4433732b.png)  I've run average_neighbor_degree with every possible combination with params source and target which implies basic attributes for directed graph. Here's my code and results:  ``` G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (6, 5), (4, 3)])  print(f'in-in: {nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="in", target= "in")}') print(f'in-out: {nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="in", target= "out")}') print(f'out-in: {nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="out", target= "in")}') print(f'out-out: {nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="out", target= "out")}')  in-in: {0: 3.0, 3: 1.3333333333333333, 1: 3.0, 2: 1.0, 4: 5.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 1.0} in-out: {0: 2.0, 3: 0.3333333333333333, 1: 2.0, 2: 2.0, 4: 3.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0} out-in: {0: 3.0, 3: 2.0, 1: 3.0, 2: 1.0, 4: 2.5, 5: 0.0, 6: 2.0} out-out: {0: 2.0, 3: 0.5, 1: 2.0, 2: 2.0, 4: 1.5, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0} ```  Looking at this graph I don't understand how this is calculated and from where those results come from. It maybe a bug or it's something I don't understand how this alogrithm works. Either way could somone explain it to me please?
