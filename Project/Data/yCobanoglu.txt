Calculating Line Graph from Incidence Matrix doesn't equal Line Graph from Networkx#TITLE_END#### Description  Derivation from Line Graph from Unsigned Incidence Matrix for undirected Graphs seems to be incorrect Formula: $L(G) = U^{T} U - 2  I$ [Wikiedia: Incidence Matrix (Formula to get Line Graph from Unsigned Incidence Matrix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix) [Wikipedia: Line Graph (Section with Formula)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph#Other_related_graph_families)  ### Current Behavior  $L(G)  =$ Line Graph Adjacency Matrix $U =$ Unsigned incidence matrix of undirected graph  $L(G)  \neq U^{T}  U - 2 I$   ### Expected Behavior  $L(G)  =$ Line Graph Adjacency Matrix $U =$ Unsigned incidence matrix of undirected graph  $L(G) = U^{T} U - 2  I$  ### Steps to Reproduce  ```python import networkx as nx import numpy as np  graph = nx.stochastic_block_model([200, 200], [[0.2 , 0.2], [0.2, 0.2]]) line_graph = nx.to_numpy_array(nx.line_graph(graph))  incidence_matrix = nx.incidence_matrix(graph).toarray() line_graph_ = incidence_matrix.T @ incidence_matrix - 2 * np.eye(incidence_matrix.shape[1]) assert np.allclose(line_graph, line_graph_) ``` Running Code results in **➔ AssertionError**   ### Environment Python version: 3.10.8 NetworkX version: 2.8.8
