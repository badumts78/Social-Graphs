Correlate node_size to radius of node#TITLE_END#Hi, I know it's possible to set the positions of my nodes. For example, I can spawn a node at (20, 20) easily.  However, I would like to know if there is an easy way to set the radius of this node. For example, if my node is at (20, 20), if I give it a radius of 10, it should go from 10 to 30 (in x).  I can only tweak the size of the node with ```node_size``` for now. The default for ```node_size``` is 300, what does it correspond to ?  Is it possible ?
