Just wanted to add that I have also found need for shortest path algorithms with path restrictions. Basically I have a road atlas with nodes ad road intersections and streets as the edges. One-way streets are handles using a Digraph. However there are other driver restrictions, e.g. sometimes you cannot make a left turn.  Given 3 nodes [1,2,3], it is feasible to traverse from node 1 to 2 and also form 2-3, but it is not possible to traverse the sequence 1-2-3. But it is feasible to travel  the sequence 3-2-1.  IT should also be possible to travel 1-2-x-3 for any other node x.   I modified the a\* algorithm to test if the current head of the explored path is in a set of restricted sub-paths. A single parameter gets passed to a*, the function that will return True or False if the current path is valid or not. The complexity lies in this function.Most of my restricted sequences are only 3 nodes, so a quick check to see if the latest 3 nodes in order exist in a set of restricted sub-paths (tuples). Some of my restricted paths are longer so there is some iteration that is not implemented very fast but these restrictions are rare.   I don't know how far the above discussion and implementation has gone towards providing such functionality but I wanted to let the developers know that there is demand for having shortest-path algorithms with restricted sub-paths.

That is an interesting idea that I hadn't thought of.  My concern would be how many of the algorithms work, e.g. I use edge attributes to encode the distance between nodes allowing a\*  algorithms and variants.  My change to the a\* was really tiny, the only complexity I had was checking is the end of a sequence of nodes exists in the set of  restricted paths, which is mostly easy except for restricted paths with many edges, even then if is maybe 6 lines of code.   I just wanted to let the developers know that there are common instances when you want to restrict shortest paths.

If there is no left turn than an edge doesn't connect those two nodes. This might relieve the issue of restricted sub-paths. But there may be other issues with this approach. I haven't used it myself.  > Dan  >  > On Oct 23, 2012, at 12:04 PM, timstirling wrote:  >  > > Just wanted to add that I have also found need for shortest path algorithms with path restrictions.
