Fix complete_to_chordal_graph to Ensure Proper Chordal Completion and PEO#TITLE_END#This PR resolves inconsistencies in the complete_to_chordal_graph function by improving its correctness, efficiency, and adherence to the expected behavior. The update aligns the function with the behavior discussed in [Issue #6873](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6873).  Changes Made:   1. Refactored complete_to_chordal_graph for better clarity and efficiency.  2. Ensured proper chordal completion while maintaining the Perfect Elimination Order (PEO).  3. Improved documentation and added inline comments for better understanding.  4. Verified changes using git diff to capture only the intended modifications.  How This Helps:   Fixes inconsistencies in chordal graph completion.  Ensures the function produces correct PEO outputs.  Improves code readability and maintainability.  Testing & Verification: 	•	Added unit tests to verify correctness. 	•	Ran all test cases to confirm no breaking changes.  Looking forward to feedback from the mentors!

Fix complete_to_chordal_graph to Ensure Proper Chordal Completion and PEO#TITLE_END#This PR addresses Issue #6873 by improving the complete_to_chordal_graph function to ensure it correctly transforms a graph into a chordal graph while generating a valid Perfect Elimination Ordering (PEO).  Key Changes: 	•	 Refined missing edges logic to enforce the chordal property. 	•	 Replaced update_nodes with clique_nodes for better clarity and weight updates. 	•	 Optimized subgraph checks to ensure minimal triangulation while maintaining efficiency. 	•	 Enhanced code readability and correctness while preserving the original algorithm’s intent.  Tests & Verification: 	•	 Added a unit test in tests/test_chordal_completion.py to verify correctness. 	•	 Ensured nx.is_chordal(H) == True for various graph cases. 	•	 Verified that the elimination ordering (alpha) is valid and includes all nodes.  This PR helps resolve inconsistencies in chordal graph completion and aligns the implementation with the expected behavior discussed in Issue #6873.
