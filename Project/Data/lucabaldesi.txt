add internet_as_graph generator#TITLE_END#Hi, I am a researcher at the University of Trento, Italy and I would like to contribute to the NetworkX project adding a random graph generator algorithm I implemented following a state-of-art autonomous system network model.  This algorithm, called "Internet AS graph", follows the approach detailed in [1] and it outputs a NetworkX Graph whose nodes can be "tier 1", "mid-level", "customer" or "content provider" BGP ASs and whose edges model economic relationships between ASs (peering, or service provider).  I implemented the generator mainly for the project I have been working on, "Internet on Fire", part of the "[Fed4FIRE](https://www.fed4fire.eu/)" H2020 experiment project group. However, since AS and BGP protocol analysis is still an active field, I think it can also be useful to the community.  I prepared the files as described in the [documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html) but I am obviously available for any needed changes.

add Spectral Graph Forge generator#TITLE_END#Hi, I am a PhD. student at the University of Trento, Italy and I would like to contribute to the NetworkX project adding a random graph generator algorithm that me and my co-authors have recently published in an international peer-reviewed conference.  This algorithm, called Spectral Graph Forge (SGF), computes the eigenvectors of a given graph adjacency matrix, filters them and build a random graph with a similar eigenstructure. SGF has been proved to be particularly useful for synthesizing realistic social networks and it can also be used to anonymize graph sensitive data. Our paper, L. Baldesi, C. T. Butts, A. Markopoulou, "Spectral Graph Forge: Graph Generation Targeting Modularity", [IEEE Infocom](http://infocom2018.ieee-infocom.org/), 2018, has a [pre-print version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01715) available online.  I prepared the files as described in [the documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html) but I am obviously available for any needed changes.  Best, Luca
