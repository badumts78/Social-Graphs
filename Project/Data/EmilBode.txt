write_gexf crashes when node-attributes are list#TITLE_END#**Problem** When making a grah where (some) attributes are lists, write_gexf crashes, without a good explanation.  **Reproducible example** ``` import networkx as nx G=nx.Graph() G.add_node('MyNode', myattr=['Att1','Att2']) nx.write_gexf(G, 'C:\\Users\\Emil\\Desktop\\temp.gexf') ``` This gives me: ``` Traceback (most recent call last):    File "<ipython-input-1-f3eb8f049e9d>", line 4, in <module>     nx.write_gexf(G, 'C:\\Users\\Emil\\Desktop\\temp.gexf')    File "<C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\decorator.py:decorator-gen-756>", line 2, in write_gexf    File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\utils\decorators.py", line 240, in _open_file     result = func_to_be_decorated(*new_args, **kwargs)    File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\gexf.py", line 88, in write_gexf     writer.add_graph(G)    File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\gexf.py", line 315, in add_graph     self.add_nodes(G, graph_element)    File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\gexf.py", line 362, in add_nodes     node_data, default)    File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\gexf.py", line 445, in add_attributes     for val, start, end in v:  ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3) ``` The actual cause seems to be line 443 in `gexf.py` (2 lines up), where `if isinstance(v, list)` treats lists different, probably expecting some specific kind of data there. Maybe the check for *dynamic data* needs to be more extensive?  I'm not sure if this is fully fixable (I don't even know if multi-valued attributes are even allowed in `.gexf`-files), but a more informative error message would be nice.  **System details** System: WIndows 10, 64-bit Python: 3.7.3 (64-bit) (also on 3.7.1/64) Run from Spyder, version 3.3.4 (also on 3.3.2) Networkx version: 2.3 (also on 2.1 and 2.2)
