Create changes Long node names break nx_pydot.pydot_layout (and possi…#TITLE_END#…bly others) #7648  There was a problem with the nx_pydot.pydot_layout function in NetworkX when you had really long node names. It would mess up the layout and cause errors.  We fixed this by making the code smarter. Now it checks if the node exists before trying to find its position, and it gives you a clear error message if it can't find it or if there's a problem with the position information.  This makes the layout function more reliable, so it won't crash anymore even if you have long or weird node names.  <!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code.

There's a problem with the nx_pydot.pydot_layout function in NetworkX when you try to use it with really long node names. It can cause errors because it doesn't handle these long names correctly.  To fix this, we need to update the code to be smarter about how it deals with empty nodes and raise a clear error message if it can't find the nodes you're looking for. This will stop the errors from happening when you have long node labels.  We might need to do some more testing to make sure this fix works with other parts of the code that have to do with layout

The issue occurs because Python's -OO optimization flag removes docstrings, causing self._orig_doc to be None. This leads to an AttributeError when calling rstrip() on None. The solution adds a check to ensure that self._orig_doc is not None before using rstrip(). If it's None, the method now safely returns the additional documentation without trying to access a non-existent docstring. This fix prevents crashes when running Python with the -OO flag.
