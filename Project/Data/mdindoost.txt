NetworkX has a logical problem on subgraph isomorphism#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior finding isos less than expected! for my graphs it finds 7 NetworkX version: 3.1 NetworkX subgraph_isomorphism found ISOs: 7 Subgraph isomorphisms found: {3: 0, 4: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3} {3: 0, 4: 1, 1: 2, 8: 3} {4: 0, 5: 1, 2: 2, 9: 3} {7: 0, 4: 1, 8: 2, 1: 3} {8: 0, 5: 1, 9: 2, 2: 3} {8: 0, 7: 1, 4: 2, 6: 3} {9: 0, 8: 1, 5: 2, 7: 3} <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior it should find 15 isos! VF2 subgraph_isomorphism run and this is the found ISOs: 15 [1 3 4 7] [1 3 4 0] [2 4 5 8] [2 4 5 1] [3 4 1 5] [3 4 1 8] [4 8 7 5] [4 1 3 0] [4 5 2 9] [5 2 4 1] [7 4 8 5] [7 4 8 1] [8 7 4 6] [8 5 9 2] [9 8 5 7] <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  import networkx as nx          # Creating directed graphs     G = nx.DiGraph()     H = nx.DiGraph()      # Clearing graphs (optional in this context)     G.clear()     H.clear()      # Adding nodes and edges to directed graphs     G.add_nodes_from(range(0, 10))     G.add_edges_from([(3, 0), (1, 3), (4, 1), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4), (4, 5),                        (3, 7), (7, 6), (4, 8), (5, 9),(1, 0),(2,1),(8, 7), (7,4), (8, 5), (9,8)])      H.add_nodes_from(range(0, 4))     H.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3)])     #H.add_edges_from([(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 0)])      node_label = 'NodeLabel'     edge_label = 'EdgeLabel'     nx.set_node_attributes(G, node_label, 'label1')     nx.set_edge_attributes(G, edge_label, 'Y1')      nx.set_node_attributes(H, node_label, 'label1')     nx.set_edge_attributes(H, edge_label, 'Y1')            # Find subgraph isomorphisms of H in G     GM = nx.algorithms.isomorphism.DiGraphMatcher(G, H)     subgraph_isomorphisms = list(GM.subgraph_isomorphisms_iter())      print("NetworkX subgraph_isomorphism found ISOs:", len(subgraph_isomorphisms))     print("Subgraph isomorphisms found:")     for iso in subgraph_isomorphisms:         print(iso)  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> Run the code ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.8.3 NetworkX version:3.1  ### Additional context During my implementation of the VF2 code based on the author's paper. I found something odd in your code. please take a look at these graphs. your current implementation gives 7 found which is 8 less than what I expected. I even checked with authors' implementation and ullmann algorithm both gave me 15 isos. I took a look at your code and it seems you already found the first mistake on the 2004 paper describing candidate generation. I think your mistake comes from the second misunderstanding point which is in describing the RNEW feasibility condition and the way you describe and implement it.  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> ![photo_2023-12-16_14-36-02](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/120276281/2b3e0b8f-fb14-47ab-8bdb-1b0fa204400c)
