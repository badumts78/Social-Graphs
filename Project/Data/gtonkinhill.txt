issue
write_gml does not allow for empty lists as attributes#TITLE_END#The write_gml function does not handle empty lists as attributes. I'm not sure if this is expected behaviour.   ### Current Behavior Fails to convert an empty list to a string and raises the error `networkx.exception.NetworkXError: [] is not a string`  ### Expected Behavior I would expect an empty list to be written to the GML file as '[]'  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.complete_graph(4) G.nodes[0]['test']=[] nx.write_gml(G,'test.gml') ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.9.5 NetworkX version: 2.5.1
