issue
average_clustering defaults undefined to 0#TITLE_END#there are 3 cases: 1- nodes with clustering_coefficient undefined (if it has < 2 neighbours) 2- nodes with clustering_coefficient= 0 3- nodes with clustering_coefficient > 0  networkx takes nodes in the first case as having clustering=0 . Gephi ignores nodes in case 1, and only averages over nodes in cases 2 and 3  This difference can have a significative impact on the result if there are many nodes in class 1  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5036575/82391333-6d7c2800-9a17-11ea-885f-52aed506d470.png)  ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from([1,2,3,4,5,6]) G.add_edges_from([(1,2),(2,3),(3,1)]) result = nx.average_clustering(G) ``` in networkx, `result==0.5` while in gephi `result==1.0`  is there a 'right' answer about what to do with nodes in case 1 ?
