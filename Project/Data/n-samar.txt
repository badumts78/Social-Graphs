contracted_nodes - KeyError when nodes are objects#TITLE_END## Code that produces the bug ```python class Stuff:     def __init__(self, a, b):         self.a = a         self.b = b ``` Create a graph with nodes as instances of the above class: ```python >>> g = netx.Graph() >>> s1 = Stuff(1, 2) >>> s2 = Stuff(1, 5) >>> g.add_edge(s1, s2) >>> netx.contracted_nodes(s1, s2) KeyError: <__main__.stuff object at 0x036E5F50> ``` # The problem The line of code that causes the issue is line 345 in _minors.py_: ```python H = G.copy() ``` and later on when node _v_ is used as a key to _H_ in line 359: ```python v_data = H.nodes[v] ``` Since _copy()_ will create new object instances for its nodes, _H.nodes_ will not contain the key _v_.
