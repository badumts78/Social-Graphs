Hi @PurviChaurasia, can you help me out with something? How are you generating this table of test coverage? Can you please share the steps with me? I have tried running coverage and pytest on the directories and files I want but it isn't working out. If you could point me to some resources, It'll be a big help.

Thankyou so much, it's working now.
