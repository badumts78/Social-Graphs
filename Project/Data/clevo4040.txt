karate_club_graph()#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> Zachary's karate club has 17 members in each of the two communities. The original paper, other literature, Barabarsi's Network Science, and other online references suggest that the size of each community is 16 and 18, not 17 and 17. This suggest that at least one of the club member nodes is initialized wrong here: club1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21} len(club1) is 17.    ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: NetworkX version: 2.6.3 and 2.8.4   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
