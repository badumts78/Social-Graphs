issue
'module' object has no attribute 'read_dot'#TITLE_END#Hello  I noticed a little problem with the import of the function read_dot. In version 1.9.1 there is no problem :  ``` sh $ pip freeze decorator==4.0.10 networkx==1.11 pygraphviz==1.3.1 ```  ``` python import networkx as nx  nx.read_dot("file.dot") ```  But recently I have upgrade the libs in my project and networkx is now in version 1.11 :  ``` sh $ pip freeze decorator==4.0.10 networkx==1.9.1 pygraphviz==1.3.1 ```  ``` python import networkx as nx  nx.read_dot("file.dot") ```  Result : Traceback (most recent call last):   File "parse_dex_opcodes.py", line 121, in <module>     main()   File "parse_dex_opcodes.py", line 24, in main     graph = load_call_graph(args.call_graph_path)   File "parse_dex_opcodes.py", line 29, in load_call_graph     return nx.read_dot(call_graph_path) AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'read_dot'  I should write instead :   ``` python import networkx as nx  nx.drawing.nx_agraph.read_dot("file.dot") ```  Am I doing something wrong or it is a real issue ?  Thank you
