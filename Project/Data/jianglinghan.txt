issue
About 'intersection' function#TITLE_END#Why intersection need the nodes lists to be  the same?  In my case,  ``` G1 = nx.Graph() G1.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]) G2 = nx.Graph() G2.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])  ``` I want to get the intersection between G1 and G2, but it can't be done by 'intersection'.  Can anyone explain the motivation of this requirement ?
