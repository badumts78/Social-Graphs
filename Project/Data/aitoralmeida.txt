Label propagation#TITLE_END#Added the label-propagation community detection as explained in #617 using Tyler Rush's code. Modified it to comply with the structure proposed in #951 (using yield and returning sets instead of lists or frozensets). Some minor fixes (now python supports using max() with sets) and style changes.

Asynchronous Label Propagation Algorithm for community detection#TITLE_END#Asynchronous label propagation algorithm for community detection described in [1]_. The algorithm is non-deterministic and the found communities may vary on different executions. Slightly modified to be able to take into account the weight of the edges when choosing the node labels.  [1] Raghavan, Usha Nandini, Réka Albert, and Soundar Kumara. "Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks." Physical Review E 76.3 (2007): 036106.  EDIT: The difference with the one implemented in #1259 is that this one is asynchronous while the other is semi-synchronous. I will try to add a synchronous algorithm also to have the three options available.

Girvan-Newman algorithm for community structure discovery#TITLE_END#Implementation of the Girvan-Newman algorithm for community structure discovery: - Girvan, Michelle, and Mark EJ Newman. "Community structure in social and biological networks." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 99.12 (2002): 7821-7826. - Newman, Mark EJ, and Michelle Girvan. "Finding and evaluating community structure in networks." Physical review E 69.2 (2004): 026113. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girvan%E2%80%93Newman_algorithm  Complies with the structure proposed in #951 (using yield and returning sets instead of lists/frozensets)
