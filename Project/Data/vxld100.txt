issue
neighbors function returns iterator, not list#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  As of right now networkx.neighbors(graph, node) returns a `dict_keyiterator` object, and not a `list` as stated on the [official documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.neighbors.html).  ### Environment  Python version: 3.11.5 NetworkX version: 3.2.1  ### Example  ``` import networkx as nx  line = "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The (2005)/Fry, Stephen (I)/Stanley, Jack (III)/Plaskitt, Nigel/Gatiss, Mark/Gomez, John (II)/Donn, Ray/Blackner, Danny/Jennings, Garth/Walker, Patrick (III)/Longhurst, Mark/Bodrozic, Milo/Jones, Simon (I)/Blake, Jerome (I)/Wilson, Mak/Bailey, Bill (IV)/Solle, Sean/Woodington, Albie/Uttley, Ben/Grindle, Steve/Griffiths, Richard (I)/Hewitt, Art/McNeice, Ian/Stuart, Ashley/Nathaniel, Paul/Lennon, Thomas (III)/Ball, Mason/Def, Mos/Wright, Edgar/Shearsmith, Reece/Freeman, Martin (II)/Schwartzman, Jason/Rockwell, Sam/Dawson, Martin/Davis, Warwick (I)/Nouri, Mohsen/Thrift, James/Kay, Ian (II)/Riley, Jessie/Horseman, Rob/Rickman, Alan/Hibbs, Simon/Ellis, Dan (III)/Freeman, Aron/Nighy, Bill/Wollen, William/Lewis, Mike (VIII)/Malkovich, John/Stevens, Tucker/Perrin, Tim/Pemberton, Steve/Johnston, Rich/Stevenson, Mark (II)/Parham, Ollie/Wilding, Spencer/Lynn, Jim/McInness, Nikki/Elliot, Su/Fay, Cecily/Adams, Polly Jane/Chancellor, Anna/Burroughs, Hayley/Kubaisi, Zoe/Deschanel, Zooey/Belson, Jane/Bennett, Sarah/Mirren, Helen/Bruce, Lynn Robertson/Gossling Valerio, Susie/Jackson, Dominique/Macdonald, Kelly (I)"  graph = nx.Graph()  movie_info = line.split('/') title = movie_info[0]  performers = movie_info[1:]  for p in performers:     graph.add_edge(title, p)  def get_list_of_performers(g, title):     performers = nx.neighbors(g, title)     print(type(performers))  def main():     get_list_of_performers(graph, "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The (2005)")  if __name__ == "__main__":     main() ```  output: `<class 'dict_keyiterator'>`  expected output: `<class 'list'>`  ### Edit  I would like to bring attention to the inadequacy of source code explanations in the documentation, particularly evident in functions like [neighbors(G, n)](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/classes/function.html#neighbors). The provided source code lacks ANY insight into the implementation details of the function, making it challenging for users to grasp the underlying mechanics. This essentially defeats the purpose of having documentation in the first place.
