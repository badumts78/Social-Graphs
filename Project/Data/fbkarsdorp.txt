Raise NetworkXError when k < 2#TITLE_END#As far as I understand, the connected caveman graph isn't defined when the size of cliques is < 2. However, there are no constraints on the parameters of the function `nx.generators.community.connected_caveman_graph()`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/eb75efa80831a08d58f17e54db20e1bfc11b67cc/networkx/generators/community.py#L85, and when called with `l=1`, the function raises the following somewhat unclear error:  ```python >>> nx.connected_caveman_graph(3, 1)  NetworkXError: The edge 0-1 is not in the graph ```  The PR ensures a slightly more informative error is raised when the function is called with `l=1`.
