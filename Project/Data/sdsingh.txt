Iterative Deepening Search#TITLE_END#While looking through networkx code, I didn't find functionality for iterative deepening search.   Is this functionality available? If not, would there be any interest in adding this to networkx? It is a really simple algorithm with reasonably heavy usage in practice.  
comment
I just drafted an implementation of Iterative Deepening DFS, which uses DLS. I can switch to your implementation if you believe it is better. However, I'm a bit wary of the empty list default parameter for stack, you are likely to get bad behavior (e.g. http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm). I'll submit a pull request for my implementation tomorrow, and we can combine efforts then.   It does seem a bit off to keep IDDFS in traversals, since it is not really a full graph traversal, and as such doesn't really fit the same structure as the other algorithms in traversals. Perhaps a search module would be useful? However, I also understand keeping the search algorithms in traversals.
