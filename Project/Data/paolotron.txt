Missing documentation for output of ```optimal_edit_paths``` function#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  The current description in the documentation for the ```optimal_edit_paths``` function is:  ```     edit_paths: list of tuples (node_edit_path, edge_edit_path)          node_edit_path : list of tuples (u, v) edge_edit_path : list of tuples ((u1, v1), (u2, v2))     cost : numeric          Optimal edit path cost (graph edit distance). ``` while it states the type of output, there is no explanation on how to interpret the result. On stackoverflow there is a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73696000/how-to-interpret-the-output-of-networkx-optimal-edit-paths) where users don't know how to interpret the output of such function.
