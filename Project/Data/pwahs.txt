Directed edges in MultiDiGraph not handled correctly by subgraph monomorphism#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  A directed graph without edges should not have a subgraph monomorphic to a digraph with one edge. However, current implementation says it is monomorphic.  ### Expected Behavior  It should not be considered monomorphic.  ### Steps to Reproduce  import networkx as nx  G = nx.MultiGraph() G.add_node("A", label="A") G.add_node("B", label="B") H = nx.MultiGraph([["A", "B"]]) # one edge matcher = nx.isomorphism.GraphMatcher(G, H) print(matcher.subgraph_is_monomorphic()) ## False, as expected  G = nx.MultiDiGraph() G.add_node("A", label="A") G.add_node("B", label="B") H = nx.MultiDiGraph([["A", "B"]]) # one edge matcher = nx.isomorphism.GraphMatcher(G, H) print(matcher.subgraph_is_monomorphic()) ## True, should be false  ### Environment  Ubuntu 22.04 inside Windows 10 WSL  Python version: Python 3.12.3 NetworkX version: 3.4.2  ### Additional context  My suspicion as to what is going on:   Say the edge is A -> B. I suspect A is mapped first and added into core_1. A has no mapped neighbor yet that needs to check the edge existence, so it's fine. And when B is mapped and added, it has no (outgoing) neighbors, so the edge is also not checked. The program never notices that the "monomorphism" is missing the directed edge.
