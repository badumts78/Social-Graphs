Assertion error for unweighted maximum matching#TITLE_END#Consider the following example with networkx 2.2: ```python import networkx G = networkx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from([('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C')]) networkx.algorithms.matching.max_weight_matching(G) ``` which throws an assertion error: ``` ~/.virtualenvs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/matching.py in max_weight_matching(G, maxcardinality, weight)     965     # Verify that we reached the optimum solution (only for integer weights).     966     if allinteger: --> 967         verifyOptimum()     968      969     return matching_dict_to_set(mate)  ~/.virtualenvs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/matching.py in verifyOptimum()     731                     break     732                 s += 2 * blossomdual[bi] --> 733             assert s >= 0     734             if mate.get(i) == j or mate.get(j) == i:     735                 assert mate[i] == j and mate[j] == i  AssertionError:  ```  My intuition is that verifyOptimum maybe fails because there isn't a single optimum max weight matching? But returning _any_ of the max weight matches would be fine for me. Is there a way to avoid the assertion error?
