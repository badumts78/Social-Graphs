issue
Mehlorn Steiner Tree#TITLE_END#Hi, I noticed a mismatch between the paper pseudo code and the code.   At the first step of the algo the papers : **_Construct the complete distance graph G₁ =(V, E1, d1), where V₁= S and, for every (Vi,Vj) in  E, d₁(Vi,Vj) is equal to the distance of a shortest path from Vi to Vj in G._**  The previous implementation mistook the distance for the length of the path (number of nodes in the path). So I changed this to the distances provided by the call to `nx.multi_source_dijkstra`  ![Capture d'écran 2025-05-18 195908](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd96b876-8cfe-4ce0-a201-d1279411a746)
