issue
Add viz attribute access data to tutorial#TITLE_END#I've been trying to print a GEXF file with viz data, and only after ~2 hours of wandering around, did I find that it wanted a 4 level nested dictionary....   Sidenote: it seems like graph_write and the special graph attributes ex. viz are somewhat 'hidden' aspects? 
comment
is this still open - as in the code hasn't yet been contributed? 
comment
You're supposed to first fork the library, make the code fix, and then file a pull request.  
comment
lol you should break this into lots and lots of small changes.  also @hagberg  in general it's just formatting things really - it shouldn't break code 
comment
also @jfinkels  using autopep8 without looking at it's results is not a good idea. it attempts formatting with ASTs, that doesn't mean it does anything for how it visually looks - e.g. it breaks groups of objects in the middle sometimes which isn't necessarily the best thing to do and is also mentioned in pep8  
comment
hmm, what about having future packages compliant? > slow integration as suggested

darn missed it, sorry :)

the proposal should be much much longer - look at previous examples  On Mon, Feb 23, 2015 at 1:18 PM, chebee7i notifications@github.com wrote:  > Both @bjedwards https://github.com/bjedwards and I have visited the > networkx gitter room: https://gitter.im/networkx >  > That seems more than fine for an IRC equivalent.

technically first project proposal and like - second work now and work for gsoc would be seperate - that is technically a paid project  On Thu, Feb 19, 2015 at 12:44 PM, chebee7i notifications@github.com wrote:  > I think it would be helpful if we familiarized ourselves with how various > graph databases, such as Neo4j, deal with sql-like queries on graphs.

We should throw an error when using those modules ...

also delete that directory - looks like you interrupted it midway  On Fri, Jul 19, 2013 at 8:00 PM, mh602653 notifications@github.com wrote:  > thanks for your quick response.

as wschlauch said, can you give anything to replicate it. It's very unlikely that the centrality cannot be calculated.

... i'm pretty sure this isn't on our end. 1/0 is a python thing  On Wed, May 22, 2013 at 5:23 PM, Aric Hagberg notifications@github.comwrote:  > We could add an error check if this message is too confusing. >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/872#issuecomment-18308900 > .

just ran it. got http://i.imgur.com/S04vcbL.png. are you sure you're using the right version of everything?  I'm on Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 15:08:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32. Using the Python download ~~ not cygwin. using binaries  actually I might be using slightly older libs ironically: networkx (1.7) matplotlib (1.1.0) 
comment
also you're on a win box. Try reinstalling cygwin / using a vm to run the same script. 
comment
what's wrong with this fix ...? 
comment
haha no problem :) @hagberg
