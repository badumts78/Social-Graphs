issue
relabel_node change of two nodes is not displayed in the adjacency_matrix of the graph#TITLE_END#```python import networkx as nx nodes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 6)] G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from(nodes) G.add_edges_from(edges)  print('Adjacency matrix before relabel:') print(nx.adjacency_matrix(G).todense()) print('\n Linked list before the relabel') print(list(G.edges))  mapping = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 6, 6: 5} G_r = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping)  print('Adjacency matrix after relabel:') print(nx.adjacency_matrix(G_r).todense()) print('\n Linked list after the relabel') print(list(G_r.edges)) ``` Output:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29864544/64821862-0f5b9300-d5b4-11e9-9c1b-01250a2d6e82.png)  The relabeling introduced the difference in edges (see the linked list), but not in adjacency matrix.
