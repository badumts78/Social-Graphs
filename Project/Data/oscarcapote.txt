issue
Meaning of the node size#TITLE_END#Hello, I want to draw nodes like a ring chart. For example I want a three rings node of three of size = 400 with three colors, I plot for example that every ring has 1/3 of the area of the original size. The problem is that it seems that they don't have the same area. For that reason I want to know the meaning of the size, if is a radius, an area...
