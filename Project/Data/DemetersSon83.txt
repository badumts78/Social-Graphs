issue
Added cluster_layout method to layout.py#TITLE_END#Cluster_layout will create a position dict where nodes within the same clusters are closer together than nodes in different clusters.  Gaussian noise is used to introduce positional variation both within and outside of clusters.  <!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code.
