issue
Return edges when using dijkstra_path#TITLE_END#It would be helpful if the shortest path algorithms could return the edges that were used and not a list of nodes.   Use case: A simple metro map  ``` MG = nx.MultiDiGraph() MG.add_edges_from([     ('A','B',{'duration':4, 'line':1}),     ('A','B',{'duration':7, 'line':2}),      ('B','C',{'duration':1, 'line':3}),      ('A','C',{'duration':20, 'line':4}) ]) path = nx.dijkstra_path(MG,'A','C', 'duration') length = nx.dijkstra_path_length(MG,'A','C', 'duration') print path print length ```  When calculating the shortest path between Stop A and Stop B, I need to know which edge was used, because there are multiple trains between two stations with different durations.
