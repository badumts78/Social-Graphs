Remove duplicate license parameter#TITLE_END#The [Python packaging specifications](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata) indicate that the [`license` parameter](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#license) to `setup()` should be used in one of the following cases:  * the license is not a selection from the “License” Trove classifiers * to specify a particular version of a license which is named via the `Classifier` field * to indicate a variation or exception to such a license  This PR removes the explicit `license` parameter since the usage for this project does not fit any of those cases and it makes it more difficult to use tools like [pip-licenses](https://pypi.org/project/pip-licenses) since it is not consistent with other projects that just have `License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License` as one of their trove classifiers.  Please note that this does _not_ change the license of the project in any way, and since this project already has a `License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License` trove classifier the `license` parameter is redundant.
