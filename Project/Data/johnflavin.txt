Invalid link in girth docs - missing close parenthesis )#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  The HTML documentation for the [girth](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cycles.girth.html) function contains an invalid link. The URI is valid in the [source code docstring](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/9cc8b422a512e7e7819238d597fd6815ec9c1c8e/networkx/algorithms/cycles.py#L1205) from which the HTML is generated.  In the docstring, the URI ends with a close parenthesis `)` character: ```     References     ----------     .. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory) ``` In the generated HTML for the docs, the close parenthesis `)` character is outside the link, making the link invalid. ``` <p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory</a>)</p> ```  ### Additional context  I'm sure this is an issue upstream when the docs are being generated. I was initially going to report this to sphinx instead of here. However, I decided to report it here instead for two reasons: 1. I don't know if the issue is with sphinx itself or the autodoc extension. I would look in the build logs for the networkx docs build job, but I don't know how to find that. I figured someone more familiar with maintaining networkx would know how and where to find those logs to dig for more information. 2. If there is some upstream update that fixes this issue, networkx would need to bump a dependency version to include that fix. So it still makes sense to open an issue here.
