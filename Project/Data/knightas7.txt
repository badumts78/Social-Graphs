Issue about "weighted closeness centrality"#TITLE_END#Hi. I don't know it has been dealt with yet, but I found a possible bug about "weighted closeness centrality"  It says nx.closeness_centrality(graph) returns inbound closeness_centrality and it worked as it. But when you use nx.closeness_centrality(graph, distance='distance'), it returns outbound one.  I tried it with a element of distance which all has a value of 1. It gives me the exact centrality value as nx.closeness_centrality(graph). But only with a reversed direction.  So, when I calculate inbound/outbound degree, weighted inbound/outbound degree, inbound/outbound closeness centrality, they all returns the same direction. But weighted closeness centrality returns the reversed one.  If Node1 has 0 inbound degree centrality, 0 weighted inbound centrality, 0 closeness centrality because it has no inbound connection while it has some value about outbound one, weighted closeness centrality returns some value in inbound one and 0 in outbound one.  Hope this helps to improving the module! Thanks!
