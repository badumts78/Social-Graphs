issue
dfs_edges does not correctly traverse directed multi graph?#TITLE_END#Somewhat related to #2792, I expected ```dfs_edges``` to return all edges in a connected component.  However, this doesn't seem to be the case:  ```python import networkx as nx g = nx.MultiDiGraph() g.add_node(1) g.add_node(2) g.add_node(3) g.add_edge(1, 2, label = 'A') g.add_edge(1, 2, label = 'B') # Another edge between 1, 2 g.add_edge(1, 3, label = 'C') print(g.edges()) # [(1, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)] -- Three edges overall, two between nodes 1, 2  print(list(nx.dfs_edges(g))) # [(1, 2), (1, 3)] -- Only two edges. Also, unclear which of the edges between 1, 2 is chosen. ``` Is there anything I'm missing here? Should I use some other function? If not, I'll probably implement something for my application, and I'll be happy to PR if there's interest.  Thanks!
