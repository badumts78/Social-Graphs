issue
provide tikz with degrees, not radians#TITLE_END#as mentioned on https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6357, tikz wants degrees (or radians, but these must be suffixed with `r`)
issue
to_latex(as_document=False) should not wrap output in figure env#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  `tikzpicture` wrapped in `figure` environment ``` >>> print(nx.to_latex(gn, as_document=False)) \begin{figure}   \begin{tikzpicture}     ...     \end{tikzpicture} \end{figure} ```   ### Expected Behavior  There is no extra environment around `tikzpicture`. Indeed, the latter may be used without an extra wrapper, or there can be several `tikzpicture` in a `figure`. Literal programming systems such as [SageTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/sagetex) provide ways to invoke Python from TeX macros, e.g. something like the following ```tex \documentclass{article} \usepackage{tikz}  \usepackage{sagetex}   \begin{document}  \begin{sagesilent}  import networkx as nx  g=graphs.PetersenGraph().networkx_graph() \end{sagesilent}  Here is my favourite graph: \sagestr{nx.to_latex(g, as_document=False)}  \end{document} ```  should, after processing, give a pdf with the picture of Petersen graph after the text, not placed somewhere `figure` thinks is appropriate.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Take your favourite graph as `gn` and call `print(nx.to_latex(gn, as_document=False))`  ### Environment  Python version: 3.9.2 NetworkX version:  3.0   
issue
use a generic Integral type for parameters check#TITLE_END#fixes https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2799 By right, the parameters to functions like complete_bipartite() need not be int, as long as they come from a correctly  defined Integral type. This allows direct usage of Sagemath's Integers, for instance.
issue
complete_bipartite_graph does not check parameters right#TITLE_END#Using complete_bipartite_graph (from version 2.0) from [Sagemath](http://www.sagemath.org/) shows to a bug in `complete_bipartite_graph()` - this won't happen if it did check parameters for being `int` ``` sage: import networkx sage: networkx.complete_bipartite_graph(2,3).edges() EdgeView([(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2)]) sage: networkx.complete_bipartite_graph(int(2),int(3)).edges() EdgeView([(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]) ``` It is due to Sagemath having its own integers, which are converted into something wrong by networkx (which is not so strange, as certainly it does not have to know anything about this type, but the fact that it happily outputs a graph which is not complete bipartite makes one wonder whether something is not right).  ``` sage: type(2) <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'> sage: type(int(2)) <type 'int'> ```  Note that in networkx 1.11 this issue does not arise, so this is a regression.
