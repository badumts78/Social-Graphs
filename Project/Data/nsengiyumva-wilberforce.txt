issue
Improve test coverage for matchhelpers.py#TITLE_END#Currently we don't have full coverage for algorithms in matchhelpers.py. Code blocks which are highlighted with red at codcov https://app.codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/matchhelpers.py don't have corresponding tests. The tests should be added in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/tests/test_match_helpers.py  Current Behavior We don't test all the paths the code can take us.  Expected Behavior We should be testing everything so there aren't any surprises.  Steps to Reproduce Visit https://app.codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/matchhelpers.py

Testing edgeless graph#TITLE_END#This test test_line_inverse_line_edgeless_graph() method is for checking that a graph with more than one node and 0 edges is being converted to an inverse line graph. If so a network error is raised.  Please review my contribution, I am an outreachy applicant  Thanks
