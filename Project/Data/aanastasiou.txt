Allows dictionary keys to have dots (.) in their keys during GML I/O#TITLE_END#While trying to [figure out GML serialisation](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5233), I realised that GML dictionaries could not have keys that contained dots. This PR attempts to fix that.
issue
Parse graph properties from graphml#TITLE_END#Would it be possible to also parse global properties referring to the graph itself from graphml files?  These are `key` XML tags with `for='graph'` as their attribute.  At the moment, it looks like yet another "redirection" based on the `for` attribute at [this point](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py#L695), but for a `graph_property` attribute of the `graph` dict (?).
issue
`networkx.power()` does not preserve edge attributes#TITLE_END#Given:  ``` import networkx  G = networkx.Graph() G.add_edge(0,1) G.add_edge(1,2,alpha=2) G.add_edge(2,3)  U = networkx.power(G,2)  E1 = G.edges(data=True) E2 = U.edges(data=True) ```  E1 might carry some attributes but E2 which is a superset of E1 does not carry any attributes.  Would something like:  ``` (n, nbr,{}) if not G.has_edge(n,nbr) else (n,nbr,G.edges[n,nbr]) for nbr in seen  ```  (not exactly like this, it could potentially be confined only to the edges of ``n``, since this is the node of interest at each iteration, but I hope it conveys the idea).  potentially introduce large delays at [this point](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/operators/product.py#L334)? Could it be activated on demand with the node/edge parameter convention of `data=True`?  
issue
Providing some sort of "Edge Flipping" functionality#TITLE_END#Just a suggestion, at the moment, it is impossible to flip the direction of an edge (in a directed graph) in a simple way. Instead, what you have to do is recover the edge, get its attributes, remove it and immediately add it in the opposite direction with the exact same attributes (including the edge's ID which would still be used to uniquely identify that edge as part of a path).
issue
`view_pygraphviz` fails for a `path` that is `str`#TITLE_END#In the following, `view_pygraphviz` works fine:      import networkx     G = networkx.generators.trees.random_tree(100)     networkx.drawing.nx_agraph.view_pygraphviz(G, prog="dot", args="-Nshape=box");  But when you try to specify the `path` which is supposed to be a `str`...      import networkx     G = networkx.generators.trees.random_tree(100)     networkx.drawing.nx_agraph.view_pygraphviz(G, path="mytest.png", prog="dot", args="-Nshape=box");  ...it raises `TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes` from within `pygraphviz/agraph::draw()`.  Now, if you:      import networkx     G = networkx.generators.trees.random_tree(100)     A = networkx.drawing.nx_agraph.to_agraph(G)     A.draw("mytest.png", prog="dot")  This will work fine, minus of course the specific formatting (graph, edge, node appearance) that `networkx` adds in `view_pygraphviz`.  Therefore, the "problem" must be in `view_pygraphviz`.  After a bit of experimentation, it turns out that this works:      import networkx     G = networkx.generators.trees.random_tree(100)     networkx.drawing.nx_agraph.view_pygraphviz(G, path=open("mytest.png", "w+b"), prog="dot", args="-Nshape=box");  The hint to pass a file descriptor rather than a `str` was obtained from [the documentation](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/drawing/nx_agraph.py#L425), specifically *"# Assume the decorator worked and it is a file-object."*.  Is this a bug? If not, which decorator does this function hint at?  **EDIT:**  Netowrkx version 2.1, Python version 3.5.2
