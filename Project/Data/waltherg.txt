implementation of method that finds all cliques in undirected graph#TITLE_END#This is my first attempt at contributing to an existing library so please bear with me.  I'd be thrilled if you could review my code.  As you'll see, I implemented an algorithm whose authors promise will generate all cliques (of all sizes) in an undirected graph.  The referenced paper makes heavy use of bitwise AND operations and I used Python's sets instead which hopefully works equally well.  I also have code for a sample test case provided by the authors in Fig. 4 of their referenced manuscript. If appreciated, what format should this test case come in and where in the library may I put this?
