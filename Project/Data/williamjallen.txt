issue
Label propagation documentation mistake#TITLE_END#It appears that the documentation for [this](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.label_propagation.label_propagation_communities.html) function has a typo.  Is the highlighted text supposed to be a link?  See attached screenshot.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16820599/165540206-c2e8635b-6f99-44f4-95ae-8088ea8bd773.png)

I saw this issue back when it was first created, and have been thinking about it some in the time since.  Just the other day, I was playing around with a brand new (and rather large) graph I recently created, and remembered this issue when I was in the process of computing some basic statistics about the graph.  It would have been very nice to be able to just use an `info` or `describe` function to list a few basic statistics and I would have been willing to wait a few seconds or a minute to get the results if necessary.  I like that `print(G)` and `G.info()` are fast and concise.  In my view, they would ideally provide only information that can be obtained via constant-time operations alone (e.g., number of nodes/edges, directness of the network, etc).  I am also very much in favor of adding a `G.describe()` which prints more detailed information, and runs in no more than linear time.
