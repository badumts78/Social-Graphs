Improve community metrics complexity and memory  (coverage and perfor…#TITLE_END#The original implementation of `performance` (described in https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0612) creates the complement graph, `coverage` builds several subgraphs to calculate the intra-community-edges and the inter-community-non-edges. This implementation does not build any additional graphs, the calculation is based solely on the edges of the graph, and its partition. Complexity: O(L + C^2) L - edges, C - number of communities  <!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->
