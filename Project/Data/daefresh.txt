connected_components_subgraphs VERY slow in 2.0 but not in 1.11#TITLE_END#Hi NetworkX Team: We have been using your library since 1.8 and love it.  We recently upgraded to 2.0. We have observed a **drastic** speed degradation in connected_component_subgraphs.  We need to create a list of connected_component_subgraphs copies. On a graph size of 40k ndoes this worked in under a second on 1.11.  Whereas to do the same on 2.0 it takes 20+ minutes and sometimes never completes. I created a sample below to demonstrate what we're doing:  ``` import networkx as nx graph = nx.MultiGraph() for counter in range(20000):     node_keys = [counter, counter*-1]     graph.add_path(node_keys) components = [c for c in nx.connected_component_subgraphs(graph, copy=True)] ```  The last line of code takes the longest. Any ideas?  Thanks
