issue
Longest path in DAG doesn't work with a dictionary containing a list of values#TITLE_END#Data in the form of `{'1': ['2'], '2': ['3', '4'], '3': [], '4': ['5'], '5': ['6'], '6': []}` does **not** work when finding the longest path in a directed acyclic graph.   ``` import networkx as nx  G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from(data.items()) path = nx.dag_longest_path(G) ```  However, `data = {'a':'b', 'b':'c', 'c':'d'}` works with the above code.  How can I pass a dictionary containing a list of values, instead of simple key-value pairs?  Error Trace:  ``` File digraph.py line 695, in add_edges_from     if v not in self._succ: TypeError: unhashable type: 'list' ```
