Add option to use Bellman-Ford in generic shortest-path functions#TITLE_END#Addresses #2346   This is one possible way to do this. I reworked some of the machinery to reduce conditional nesting, but there's still redundant code.  Some verbosity is inevitable - we're trying to value-dispatch on multiple parameters, which isn't usually elegant.  Another approach would be a more dramatic refactor in favor of a more functional style of passing functions around and closing them over values as needed. I've briefly sketched this out for myself, and I can share it in a gist if there's interest. My concern is that it would add complexity (at least for the casual reader) for somewhat questionable gain - how likely is it that the generic shortest-path functions will need to be extended similarly soon?  Finally: this module raises `NetworkXNoPath`, `NetworkXPointlessConcept`, and `NetworkXError` exceptions - should I factor them out, per #1705 ? It's not entirely clear to me from that issue when such refactors should occur, since they're potentially interface-breaking.

Add absent source checks#TITLE_END#Per discussion in #3098   I added the `NodeNotFound` exceptions to the docstrings for the "client" functions of `_dijkstra_multisource()` and `_bellman_ford()` as well, since that has been done elsewhere in the file for other "pass-through" exceptions.
issue
inconsistent behavior of predecessor-and-distance functions#TITLE_END#While working on #2346 , I ran into the following slightly surprising behavior:  * `dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance()` sets `pred[source]` to be `[]` * `bellman_ford_predecessor_and_distance()` sets `pred[source]` to be `[None]`  This behavior should be replicated by the following (as of commit `1a521966`): ``` >>> import networkx as nx >>> G = nx.path_graph(2) >>> nx.dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance(G, 0)[0] {0: [], 1: [0]} >>> nx.bellman_ford_predecessor_and_distance(G, 0)[0] {0: [None], 1: [0]} ```  (From the [code for `_bellman_ford()`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/1a52196699668ec5531711590621b0d4821e57ae/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py#L1166), `None` is being used as a sentinel value when constructing paths.)  This produces an error when trying to use the two algorithms' output interchangeably.  The inconsistency is small, but does seem like a bug. These two functions' return values should probably have similar conventions; the behavior of `dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance()` makes the most sense to me.

Bugfix for issue 3065#TITLE_END#Fix #3065   `circular_layout()` now raises an exception when `dim < 2`.  Also, `kamada_kawai_layout()` now uses a uniformly-spaced linear layout when `dim < 2` and `pos` hasn't been specified, rather than passing a bad parameter value to `circular_layout()`.
