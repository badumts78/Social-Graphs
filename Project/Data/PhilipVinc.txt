issue
Intersphinx mappings to NetworkX#TITLE_END#I am trying to link to networks documentation using inter sphinx mapping from our project's documentation. I am using the standard link form of  ``` intersphinx_mapping = {     "python": ("https://docs.python.org/3/", None),     "networkx": ("https://networkx.org/doc/reference/", None), } ```  but it fails with the error ```python WARNING: failed to reach any of the inventories with the following issues: intersphinx inventory 'https://networkx.org/doc/reference/objects.inv' not fetchable due to <class 'requests.exceptions.HTTPError'>: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://networkx.org/doc/reference/objects.inv ```  Are you publishing the mapping anywhere else?
