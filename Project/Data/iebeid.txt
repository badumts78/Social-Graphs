issue
The adjacency matrix generated for a directed graph might be incorrect.#TITLE_END#### Description  I was trying to create a directed graph with preset edges. After I created the graph, I tried to generate an adjacency matrix from the created directed graph. The generated adjacency just follows the order the edges provided. One of the entries of the adjacency generated using nx.adjacency_matrix() had a misplaced edge value.  ### Current Behavior  When generating an adjacency matrix for a directed graph there seems to be a misplaced 1 especially for the last edge in the list of edges predefined.  ### Expected Behavior  Correct adjacency matrix should be generated.  ### Steps to Reproduce  GD1 = nx.DiGraph() GD1.add_edges_from(     [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('D', 'B'), ('E', 'C'), ('E', 'F'),      ('B', 'H'), ('B', 'G'), ('B', 'F'), ('C', 'G')]) GD1A = np.array(nx.adjacency_matrix(GD1).todense()) print(GD1) print(GD1A)  Please work out the adjacency matrix on paper first and compare outputs.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.9.1 (Anaconda) NetworkX version: 3.1, Scipy 1.11.3  ### Additional context  ![error-networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/8671747/3ce837d2-8fa8-4746-9fa4-6b6f7053f335)
