Updated decorator requirement for #4718#TITLE_END#I'm maintaning the [`manim`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/manim/) AUR package, which depends on [`python-networkx`](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-networkx/). Due to #4718 being only solved for the latest version of [`python-decorator`](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-decorator/) in HEAD, I've started maintaining [`python-networkx-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-networkx-git/), which requieres [a manual patch](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=python-networkx-git#n23) for the `decorator` requierement version.  This small PR updates the requirements [stated by @dschult](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4718#issuecomment-819489576) so that other projects don't have to manually patch them.
