issue
A* documentation typo#TITLE_END#I'm fairly certain there's a small but confusing typo in the [documentation for A*](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/fbc901aa2d30c8dfbe145af747097e92d9b5e5c9/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/astar.py#L123). Specifically "<" in the following paragraph (linked):  ```python # if qcost < ncost, a longer path to neighbor remains # enqueued. Removing it would need to filter the whole # queue, it's better just to leave it there and ignore # it when we visit the node a second time. ```  After staring at it for a while, I think this should read "if qcost > ncost", as it's referring to the negation of the following `if qcost <= ncost` statement. Also, the text refers the enqueued path being longer.
