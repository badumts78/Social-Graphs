Fix scale_free_graph restriction#TITLE_END#`scale_free_graph` generator has a restriction, that `alpha + beta + gamma` has to be equal to `1`. However, while working with random graph parameters, it is often hard to satisfy this requirement, because   of the float representation.  Eg, this simple code doesn't work: ```python from networkx import scale_free_graph import numpy as np  np.random.seed(1) t = np.random.random(3) t = t / t.sum() G = scale_free_graph(N, alpha=t[0], beta=t[1], gamma=t[2]) ``` neither does that one ```python from networkx import scale_free_graph import numpy as np  np.random.seed(1) t = np.random.random(3) t = t / t.sum() G = scale_free_graph(N, alpha=t[0], beta=t[1], gamma=(1 - t[0] - t[1])) ``` or that one ```python from networkx import scale_free_graph import numpy as np  t = np.random.dirichlet(np.ones(3, dtype=np.float32), size=1)[0] G = scale_free_graph(10, alpha=t[0], beta=t[1], gamma=t[2]) ``` So, that's why I think just checking if `math.isclose(alpha + beta + gamma, 1.0)` would be better.
