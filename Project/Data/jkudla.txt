issue
Fix line graph construction#TITLE_END#As described in issue #5329, the line graph construction didn't work for unordered node labels. This has been fixed by numbering the nodes and ensuring a canonical representation w. r. t. the numbers (instead of attempting to compare the node labels directly).  I also included a test case that executes the lines ```python G = nx.path_graph([1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c"]) H = nx.line_graph(G) ``` which previously led to a TypeError.

Hi, can I work on this issue? I'm new to the project and followed the first steps :)  Idea would be introducing the `node_index` mapping as you described, @dschult. Run the same construction, perhaps with something like `nodes = [tuple(sorted([node_index[x[0]], node_index[x[1]]])) + x[2:] for x in get_edges(u)]`. Finally, transform the node indices back to the original node labels. This could be done using a reverse mapping `index_node` from indices back to nodes. For now, I implemented this by first constructing `L` and then building a graph `L_result` which is isomorphic to `L` but has the original labels on its nodes and edges. Any thoughts about this procedure?  I did tried some approaches and suggest the above mainly because directly incorporating the original node labels as we construct `L` seems shorter, but it's harder to make this correct as we want to rely on canonical forms for nodes and edges. Even "enriching" the nodes with their additional labels seems to make the code rather complicated.  Note that I haven't finished a PR yet since multigraphs are still an issue.

Thank you for pointing this out, that's much more elegant!
