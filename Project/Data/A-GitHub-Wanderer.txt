Oddity with networkx.eulerian_path()#TITLE_END#This function does not seem to be operating well on a particular example. This function has no restriction on directed or multigraphs, and as far as I know, the graph does not have to be strongly connected because an Eulerian path does not have to have start point and end points equal (as opposed to circuits). Here is an ASCII representation of my network:  ```  +-<-+   +-<-+ 1   2->-3   4 +->-+   +->-+  ```  Inspecting manually, there is an Eulerian path 2->1->2->3->4->3. The output I get from `eulerian_path()` varies oddly depending on the `source` argument.  ``` import networkx print("nx version", networkx.__version__) # +-<-+   +-<-+ # 1   2->-3   4 # +->-+   +->-+ G = networkx.MultiDiGraph() G.add_edges_from([   (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3) ]) print("Eulerian path, no source argument", list(networkx.eulerian_path(G))) print("Eulerian path, source 2", list(networkx.eulerian_path(G, source = 2))) print("Eulerian path, source 4", list(networkx.eulerian_path(G, source = 4))) ```  Output:  ``` nx version 2.4 Eulerian path, no source argument [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3)] Eulerian path, source 2 [(2, 1), (1, 2)] Eulerian path, source 4 [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3), (3, 4)] ```  With no source argument, it outputs the expected solution.  With the source argument equal to the source node that was previously found, it does not find a path that covers all arcs.  With a source argument that is an invalid start point for an Eulerian path, it returns a path starting from a different node, contrary to the documentation saying a warning/error will be issued. Edit: moreover, this returned path contains an arc which doesn't exist in the input graph.
