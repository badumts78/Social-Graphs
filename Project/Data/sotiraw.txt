No documentation in any centrality about what should the weights considered to be if the are given to fucntion#TITLE_END#at all centrality measures, like betweeness and all others, when mentioning about taking into consideration possible weights of the graph, it simply mentions   ""weight (None or string, optional (default=None)) – If None, all edge weights are considered equal. Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.""  The thing that is missing, is that it does not mention how these weights are interpeted by the function. For example it should say for betweeness that '' weights will be considered as distances"  So if my graph weights are strength of connection, i should see this and NOT use wights='weight' , BUT add an atribute to my graph of something like distance= 1/ weight + 0.5 ( or something like this to avoid 1/0, and pass 'distance' to the function.    in other centralities , like clustering coeficient i think that weights are indeed considered as strength of connection ( which should also be added as statement ) and there, in someones case that his weights are in fact conecction strength , then he would know to use them directly.  These statements should be added to all centralitires , and othe funtions as well,  ( look for example igraph documentation for any centrality), for example in igraph betweeness you can see " Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths, so they are interpreted as distances."  because its the only proper way to declare what your function will consider to be your graph weights, what they mean for the function , and is the only way to be used properly
