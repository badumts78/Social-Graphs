Fix bfs_predecessors to reverse edges for directed graphs#TITLE_END#This may be a misunderstanding on my part, but I believe bfs_predecessors is broken for directed graphs. Here is a sample code showing a simple example where `G.predecessors` correctly returns the predecessors, but the `nx.bfs_predecessors` fails to:  ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from([(1, 0), (2, 0)]) nx.draw_networkx(G, with_labels=True) print(list(G.predecessors(0)), list(nx.bfs_predecessors(G, 0))) [1, 2] [] ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/963909/103021179-c06f0e00-4517-11eb-850a-6e80aea88157.png)   I attached a patch .with a simple fix for this.
