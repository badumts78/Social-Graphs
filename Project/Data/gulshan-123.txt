complete_to_chordal_graph review#TITLE_END#See issue #6873.  complete_to_chordal_graph(G) returns a chordal graph H and a dictionary alpha giving the elimination ordering. alpha is sometimes meaningless (e.g., when G is already chordal — it's all zeros).  Implemented changes as suggested here: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/6873#issuecomment-1880386482  _triangulate_with_mcs: private function using original code without checking is_chordal  triangulate: returns the graph constructed using _triangulate_with_mcs complete_to_chordal_graph: checks for chordality too and returns graph as well as alpha (same as original behaviour) minimal_elimination_order(G) – return alpha only. perfect_elimination_order(G) – raise if G is not chordal. is_perfect_elimination_graph(G) – alias for is_chordal(G)
