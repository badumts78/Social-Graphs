Update MultiGraph.degree() docs: outdated return type#TITLE_END#In the past, degree() used to return an int or an iterator. In networkx#2458, the implementation was changed, so that the function returns a MultiDegreeView object, but the function docs weren't updated accordingly.  This incorrect return type causes issues in PyCharm type hinting mechanism - it thinks the function returns an int.  ![multigraph_degree_type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83541313/163168833-598ca479-c420-49cd-875c-ad6634a1d7c3.jpg)  This PR updates the declared return type to be MultiDegreeView.
