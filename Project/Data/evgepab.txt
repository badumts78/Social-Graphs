Thank you for your suggestions! We have added them and are waiting for any additional feedback! Also we were thinking of  adding weights on edges like that 'G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=0.5, time=datetime(2023, 5, 9))' instead of having an optional list as an argument.

Also, we're a bit confused as to why some of the checks failed, if you could provide us more information regarding this.

@dschult  @rossbar Thank you for your feedback! Regarding the optional function attribute, do you mean that something like: `time_dict = lambda G: {n: G.nodes[n].get("time") for n in G}` could be given in order to find the node's predecessors? And, if it's not given, then we would use all the node's predecessors?  Also, there was no specific reason for the use of `timestamp`, only to get more precise comparisons.

We're glad we could help 😊 @dschult
