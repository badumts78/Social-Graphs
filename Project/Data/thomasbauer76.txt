Implement `Treelet` extraction along with an `Example`, and a `New Path Function`#TITLE_END## Understanding Treelets  A labeled treelet is a small, connected, acyclic subgraph (tree-like structure) of a graph. In this implementation, we limit treelets to a maximum of 6 nodes (5 edges) based on experimental observations from [2], which found that increasing motif size beyond this point does not significantly improve predictive performance. Treelets capture local structural patterns and are useful in applications such as graph kernels and pattern recognition. See [1] for more details.  # Summary of Additions  This pull request introduces the following additions:  1. **New Module: `treelet.py`**    - Added functions to compute treelets and labeled treelets of a graph.    - The `treelets` function extracts treelets considering only topology (unlabeled).    - The `labeled_treelets` function extracts treelets incorporating node and edge labels.  2. **New Example: `plot_treelet.py`**    - Added an example script to illustrate the extraction and visualization of treelets in a graph.    - The script demonstrates the extraction of distributions of both unlabeled and labeled treelets.    - Provides visualizations for the 14 distinct treelet patterns as described in the referenced paper.  3. **New Function: `all_bounded_simple_paths` in `simple_paths.py`**    - Added a function to generate all simple paths in a graph with a length constraint.    - The function allows for specifying an exact length or a maximum length for the paths.    - It also allows selecting specific source nodes from which the paths will be generated.  # References - [1] B.
