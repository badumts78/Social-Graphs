Bug with shell layout when only one node in the outer shell#TITLE_END#Hi all! It is my first time posting so I hope this is useful... I was plotting a network using the shell layout and I seem to have encountered a bug. When I run the following code: ```python3 import networkx as nx  g = nx.path_graph(10) nl = [[0], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,], [9]] nx.draw_shell(g, nlist=nl, with_labels=True) ``` I would expect to have node 9 as the only node in an outer shell. I get the following output instead: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18715871/66924704-61685c00-f02b-11e9-887b-568bb6d6dc68.png) It seems that node 9 gets plotted on top of node 0. This seems to happen only when I have a single node in the outer shell, and stops happening if I add a "ghost" node: ```python3 import networkx as nx  g = nx.path_graph(10) ghost_node_index = 1000000 nl = [[0], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,], [9, ghost_node_index]] nx.draw_shell(g, nlist=nl, with_labels=True) ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18715871/66924650-4a296e80-f02b-11e9-9295-0327d0e8c143.png)  Cheers!
