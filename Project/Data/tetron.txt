 2.6 installs numpy, pandas and scipy by default#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior Installing networkx 2.6 causes numpy, scipy and pandas to be installed.  These are large packages that have complex binary dependencies.  ### Expected Behavior In networkx 2.5 and earlier, these were optional dependencies that were not installed by default.  ### Steps to Reproduce pip install networkx >= 2.6  ### Environment  Python version: 3.7.3 NetworkX version: 2.6.1 pip version: 21.1.3  ### Additional context I woke up to my build system failing because a 3rd degree transitive dependency suddenly expected gfortran :frowning_face:   I am working around it by pinning to networkx 2.5.  I'm filing this issue because it is not clear if this change in behavior was intended or not.
