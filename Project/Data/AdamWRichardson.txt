Add an optional argument to the incidence_matrix function to provide …#TITLE_END#Add an optional argument to the incidence_matrix function to provide the dtype to the scipy sparse array  This avoids extra copying of the array if you need to do `astype` after creating the array.  I've added a very basic test which can be added to. Lots of the other tests also use `astype` so I could change those as well if preferred. Thanks for the review!

Add clear edges method as a method to be frozen by nx.freeze#TITLE_END#…freeze function  `nx.freeze` was freezing most of the attributes of a graph but didn't freeze the `clear_edges` method. This PR adds that method into the list of methods to be frozen.  A different design choice would be to re-implement the freeze method to call into a `__freeze__` method on the graph. This would allow subclasses to modify the freeze method based on their needs and would also make any future ommisions like this easier to fix in subclasses. However since this is my first time contributing I went for a minimal changes.  Happy to have comments and suggestions on this!
