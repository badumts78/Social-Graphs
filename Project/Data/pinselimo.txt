Add multigraph betweenness#TITLE_END#This PR adds betweenness centrality (BC) for multigraphs. The function ```betweenness_centrality``` is currently marked as ```@not_implemented_for("multigraph")``` however ```edge_betweenness_centrality``` is not even though it suffers from the same shortcomings. With this PR both functions should yield correct results.  The PR consists of three commits addressing issues with BC for multigraphs:  ### Issues  **1. Edge betweenness centrality lacks ```not_implemented``` decorator** The first commit marks ```èdge_betweenness_centrality``` as not implemented for multigraphs. It suffers from the issues described below and should at least be marked correctly.  **2. Weighted betweenness centrality disregards weight of parallel edges** The second commit resolves an issue regarding both betweenness for nodes and edges. For multigraphs ```G[v].items()``` returns ```w, edgedata``` like usual Graphs. However, ```edgedata``` differs in that it is first indexed by edge keys instead of weight keys. The implementation hence always calculates unweighted betweenness.  ~~~python >>> G = MultiGraph() >>> G.add_edges_from(             ((0, 1, {'w':20.8}), (1, 2, {'w':1.5}), (0, 2, {'w':1.8}))             ) >>> edge_betweenness_centrality(G, weight='w') {(0, 1): 0.3333333333333333, (0, 2): 0.3333333333333333, (1, 2): 0.3333333333333333}    >>> # Correct would be: 0.0, 0.66.., 0.66... ~~~  For parallel edges we always have to consider the lowest weight. Fortunately, the weighted shortest paths module provides ```_weight_function```. Utilizing this import solves the issue.  However, this fix can only enable correct betweenness centrality for nodes. Edge betweenness centrality still suffers from the following issue.  **3. Edge betweenness centrality does not return edge keys** Calculating edge betweenness centrality gives the values but not which edge key to apply them to. This is especially a problem with the example given in [```set_edge_attributes```](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.set_edge_attributes.html). It does not work with multigraphs because of this design, however it would not fail to calculate the betweenness.  Also, parallel edges of equal weight should divide their value.  ### Correctness  Correctness was checked using property based tests with a sample size of 1000. They are contained in my [other branch](https://github.com/pinselimo/networkx/tree/check-multigraph-betweenness) in ```examples/algorithms/betweenness/check_properties.py```.  ```pytest``` has also been checked, although I haven't added additional tests so far. Give me a heads up if you deem them necessary. And of course all code has been formatted with ```black```.  Thanks, Simon
