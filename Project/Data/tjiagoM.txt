issue
configuration_model is incorrect for normal nx.Graph#TITLE_END#I needed to use `configuration_model` (https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.degree_seq.configuration_model.html) in a project but for normal `nx.Graph`.  In the documentation it is obvious that your return is a `MultiGraph`, but I want a `Graph` without any self-loops or parallel edges. The only thing you have for `Graph`s is to use `G.remove_edges_from(nx.selfloop_edges(G))`. However, by using this method it is also obvious that your resulting degree distribution will not be the same as the initial one that I want to mimic.  I ended up implementing a solution for this and would be able to make a PR with that, but I wanted to check whether you are already aware of this problem and implementing a solution already, in which case I don't need to make any PR.
