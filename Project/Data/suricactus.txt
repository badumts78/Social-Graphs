[WIP] Steiner multigraph#TITLE_END#I am proposing a change in `networkx.algorithms.approximation.steinertree` to make it work with multigraphs. This affects Dijkstra algorithms results too. The change is not complete yet, but I would be happy to get some feedback from the core maintainers on the current progress as I think the main task is done, what's left are some fixes here and there.  - [ ] update documentation of the updated functions - [ ] update tests of the updated functions - [x] add more tests for Steiner algorithm - [x] fix for unweighted multigraph  However, there is a breaking change, as Dijkstra algorithm funtions no longer returns 2 items in a tuple, but 3 (the new one for the tuples, if any, see for example `nx.single_source_dijkstra`). I am planning to use it for my project, so I need to finish it for sure.
