issue
Failing traveling salesman test#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior I help maintain a NetworkX package for the Fedora Linux distribution.  We like to run the tests when we build, to catch problems that might affect users.  One traveling salesman test, test_asadpour_tsp at line 707 of networkx/algorithms/approximation/tests/test_traveling_salesman.py in NetworkX 2.8.5, sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails.  When it fails, it finds the tour `[3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 4, 3]`, which has the same weight (402) as the expected tour `[3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 5, 3]`.  I'm curious about this comment at the bottom of the test: ```     # However, we are using a fixed random number generator so we know what the     # expected tour is. ``` Does that mean that something is wrong with the random number generator?  If so, can you give me a hint as to what I should look for?  ### Expected Behavior The tests should pass.  ### Steps to Reproduce The test failure is intermittent.  We do the build, then run pytest.  ### Environment Python version: 3.11.0~b5 NetworkX version: 2.8.5

PyYAML 5.4/5.4.1 breaks YAML loader#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> The latest attempt to build networxk 2.5 for Fedora failed to pass the test suite: ``` =================================== FAILURES =================================== ___________________________ TestYaml.testUndirected ____________________________  self = <networkx.readwrite.tests.test_yaml.TestYaml object at 0x7f57aad7f550>      def testUndirected(self): >       self.assert_equal(self.G, data=False)  networkx/readwrite/tests/test_yaml.py:44:  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  networkx/readwrite/tests/test_yaml.py:35: in assert_equal     Gin = nx.read_yaml(fname) <decorator-gen-682>:2: in read_yaml     ??? networkx/utils/decorators.py:239: in _open_file     result = func_to_be_decorated(*new_args, **kwargs) networkx/readwrite/nx_yaml.py:91: in read_yaml     G = yaml.load(path, Loader=yaml.FullLoader) /usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/yaml/__init__.py:114: in load     return loader.get_single_data() /usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/yaml/constructor.py:51: in get_single_data     return self.construct_document(node) /usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/yaml/constructor.py:55: in construct_document     data = self.construct_object(node) /usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/yaml/constructor.py:100: in construct_object     data = constructor(self, node) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   self = <yaml.loader.FullLoader object at 0x7f57aad7fd00> node = MappingNode(tag='tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object:networkx.classes.graph.Graph', value=[(ScalarNode(tag='tag:yaml.org,2...=[])), (ScalarNode(tag='tag:yaml.org,2002:str', value='g'), MappingNode(tag='tag:yaml.org,2002:map', value=[]))]))]))])      def construct_undefined(self, node): >       raise ConstructorError(None, None,                 "could not determine a constructor for the tag %r" % node.tag,                 node.start_mark) E       yaml.constructor.ConstructorError: could not determine a constructor for the tag 'tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object:networkx.classes.graph.Graph' E         in "/tmp/tmpkqn21u1g", line 1, column 1  /usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/yaml/constructor.py:427: ConstructorError ```  Identical failures happened for testDirected and testMultiGraph.

Fix reversed args in gaussian_random_partition_graph#TITLE_END#This was discovered while building networkx with python 3.9.0 alpha 4 in Fedora Rawhide.  The reversed arguments cause the decorator function to receive False as the seed argument, which leads to a very strange error down inside python's random code.
