If there is a desire to have this functionality, I'd be willing to put in a PR in the next week or so (as time allows). Just not sure if `neighbors` is really thinking about 'edges' though. When I think of the neighbors of a node, I think of other _nodes_, not the edges connecting them. The edges connecting them is a simple matter of  ``` python sink=G.neighbors(data=True).keys()[0] G.edge[source][sink] ```  where getting the data from the sink of an edge is a bit more involved:  ``` python edge=G.neighbors(data=True).keys()[0] # assume there is a neighbor G.node[edge[1]] # note the nested subscript ```  I'm very much biased to [my own use-case](https://github.com/vermiculus/ssa-tool/blob/master/ssa/core/Algorithm.org#running-it-once) (where I don't have access to the graph as a whole, I must pass the neighbors to the function), so I'm interested to hear why an edge-based solution would be better—I've no doubt that I'm missing more popular use-cases.
