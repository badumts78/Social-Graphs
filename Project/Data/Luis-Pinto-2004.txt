Bidirectional A* algorithm and test#TITLE_END#This pull request introduces a new implementation of the Bidirectional A* search algorithm in networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar.  Key points:        - Follows the structure and style of the existing A* implementation.       - Supports all features expected by NetworkX: custom weight functions, heuristics, and cutoff options.       - Includes a performance-optimized fallback with optional greedy mode.       - Provides comprehensive test coverage, integrated into test_astar.py, with directed/undirected graphs, edge cases, and cost validation.  The code passes all existing test suites and adds dedicated tests for this algorithm.  This addition aims to enhance performance on large graphs and offer more flexibility for users dealing with bidirectional heuristics.
