To add to what Neil said, stubs are "signatures" of the methods. It adds typing so that other Python applications can use them, without changing anything in the networkx codebase. @fmagin added some stubs for graph/diGraph, I added some for multigraph/multidigraph later on because I needed them for a project of mine. The advantage of using stubs is that they're independent from the networkx codebase, but they're harder to maintain and harder to check and test against the codebase.

@jarrodmillman For me, in general, static typing is really helpful after a certain threshold of project size as it detects mistakes that are not caught by testing (specially in plumbing code), and does it quicker than unit tests as you can have type check integrated in the editor. In the part of the code that uses networkx, static typing helped ensure that graphs were being created with the correct types for the object nodes, which had became a little bit of a mess already without typing. It also makes it easy to fix type errors: it becomes clear quickly whether it was a problem of not managing all possible types, or if it was an issue of the wrong type being used.   Overall, static typing (plus unit tests) was a great tool in a recent effort I had to make to simplify, improve and make more robust a module that managed different types of network topologies.   Right now there's a feature that I'm missing, that's not yet in mypy, which is https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/4441. It would allow setting types for the edge and node attributes, so I could guarantee that a certain graph object has certain attributes with certain types. For now, the code that manages the attributes is limited so it's not much of a problem, but it would certainly be very helpful to have that edge/node attribute typing.
