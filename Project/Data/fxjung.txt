issue
fixing broken decorators#TITLE_END#As described in #4722, decorator version 5.0.3 breaks various things as it now differentiates between positional arguments and keyword arguments. This adds the necessary additional logic dealing with this to `_nodes_or_number`. I'm not sure whether this is the way to go, but it would be a way to fix the situation for now. If desired I can also add a test for this.  - Resolves #4722 - Resolves #4718

decorator 5.0.3 breaks nodes_or_number decorator#TITLE_END#Various functionality of networkx is broken for `decorator==5.0.3`: In [`networkx.utils.decorators.nodes_or_number`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/utils/decorators.py#L284), keyword arguments do not end up in `args` anymore, only in `kw`,  which results in `IndexError`.  ### Current Behavior As a concrete example, `nx.generators.class.cycle_graph()` fails if graph order is given as a keyword argument.  The same applies for other graph generation methods.  ### Steps to Reproduce ```py In [1]: import networkx as nx  In [2]: nx.__version__ Out[2]: '2.6rc1.dev0'  In [3]: nx.generators.classic.cycle_graph(5) Out[3]: <networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7f5ed6faceb0>  In [4]: nx.generators.classic.cycle_graph(n=5) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-4-c2475efc656b> in <module> ----> 1 nx.generators.classic.cycle_graph(n=5)  anaconda3/envs/networkx/lib/python3.9/site-packages/decorator.py in fun(*args, **kw)     212     else:     213         def fun(*args, **kw): --> 214             return caller(func, *(extras + args), **kw)     215     fun.__name__ = func.__name__     216     fun.__signature__ = inspect.signature(func)  networkx/networkx/utils/decorators.py in _nodes_or_number(func_to_be_decorated, *args, **kw)     291         new_args = list(args)     292         for i in iter_wa: --> 293             n = args[i]     294             try:     295                 nodes = list(range(n))  IndexError: tuple index out of range  ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9.2 NetworkX version: [0740fe59](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/0740fe59be894b2d10814cbc793d2b582adc2555)  ### Additional context Possibly related to #4718
