issue
import networkx <- this code prints something#TITLE_END#Hi I'm using networkx in my recent project. I'd met a problem when I Import networkx.  When I open python3 and start with "import networkx", something prints out. Those logs are something that I had printed before, that time also I used networkx. After the "import networkx", followed by the logs, I also did "from networkx.algorithms import approximation as approx" and it gave me an error like this: "ImportError: No module named 'networkx.algorithms'; 'networkx' is not a package"  I thought this was a problem for my networkx module in my computer, so I removed all of the things that is related with networkx. But when I typed "import networkx" even when I didn't installed it again, the same logs printed out and even there was no error message that networkx does not exist. Simply speaking, all the things was the same before and after the removing networkx.  What's the problem?
