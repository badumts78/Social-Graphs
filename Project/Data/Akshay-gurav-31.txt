Enhance API Error Handling for Clearer Debugging (team_list.py) ✔️#TITLE_END#Change Details: Enhanced Error Handling  - Implemented Change: Updated the 'api(url)' function to check HTTP status codes. If the response status is `401`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "Error: Invalid GitHub token provided." For any status other than `200`, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the URL and status code.  - Rationale: This change provides clearer error feedback and simplifies debugging without altering the core functionality of the code.

Add docstrings to test methods in test_line.py#TITLE_END#**Title:** Add docstrings to test methods in test_line.py  **Description:**  I have added single-line docstrings to each test method in `networkx/generators/tests/test_line.py` to explain the purpose of the tests. These docstrings describe what each test is checking (e.g., "Test that the line graph of a star graph is a complete graph"), making the test suite more readable and easier to understand for new contributors. The docstrings are written in a clear and concise style, consistent with NetworkX's documentation standards.  This contribution aligns with NetworkX's pedagogical goals by improving the clarity of the test suite, which is especially helpful for beginners learning how NetworkX's `line_graph` and `inverse_line_graph` functions work. It is part of my GSoC 2025 proposal for the "Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks" project, where I aim to enhance documentation and learning resources for new users.  No existing test logic or core functionality has been modified, ensuring no impact on backward compatibility. I have written these docstrings myself to ensure they align with NetworkX's style and are not generated by an LLM or AI tool.  I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions to improve this contribution further. Thank you for reviewing!  Best, [Akshay Gurav]

Update layout.py#TITLE_END#Changes Made to forceatlas2_layout  New Parameter Description: Added position_range=1.0 to the function signature to allow users to specify a maximum range for node positions. Details: - A new parameter, position_range, has been included in the list of arguments for the forceatlas2_layout function. - It is set with a default value of 1.0. - This parameter enables users to define a boundary for how far nodes can spread in the layout, ensuring they stay within a specific range (e.g., from -1.0 to 1.0 by default).  Docstring Update Description: Included a description of position_range in the docstring to document its purpose and usage. Details: - The docstring, which explains the function's parameters, has been updated. - A new entry was added under the "Parameters" section: "position_range : float (default: 1.0)" followed by "Maximum range for node positions (e.g., -position_range to position_range)". - This update informs users about what position_range does and how it affects the layout, making the function's documentation more complete.  Position Constraint Description: Added pos_arr = np.clip(pos_arr, -position_range, position_range) in the iteration loop to limit node positions to the specified range. Details: - Inside the main loop that updates node positions (which runs up to max_iter times), a new line of code has been inserted. - The line is: pos_arr = np.clip(pos_arr, -position_range, position_range). - This uses NumPy's clip function to restrict the values in pos_arr (the array holding node positions) so that they do not go below -position_range or above position_range. - For example, if position_range is 1.0, all x and y coordinates of nodes will be kept between -1.0 and 1.0.  Typo Fix Description: Changed distributed_attraction to distributed_action to match the internal logic of the function. Details: - The parameter name distributed_attraction in the function signature has been corrected to distributed_action. - In the original code, it was distributed_attraction=False, but the logic inside the function uses distributed_action (e.g., in the condition if distributed_action:). - This change fixes a typo, ensuring the parameter name aligns with how it's used in the code, improving consistency and preventing potential errors.  Why These Changes Matter - Position Range Addition:   - The addition of position_range makes the layout more controllable.   - Without this parameter, nodes could spread out infinitely based on the forces calculated (like attraction and repulsion), which might result in a layout that's too spread out or hard to visualize.   - Now, with position_range, nodes are confined to a specific area (e.g., -1.0 to 1.0 by default), giving a more compact and manageable layout. - Docstring Update:   - The updated docstring helps users understand how to use the new position_range feature.   - It provides clear instructions and examples, making the function easier to use correctly. - Typo Fix:   - Changing distributed_attraction to distributed_action improves the reliability of the code.   - It ensures the parameter matches the internal logic, reducing the chance of confusion or bugs when someone uses this function
