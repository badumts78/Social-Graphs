asadpour_atsp unexpeted behaviour for digraph with just two nodes.#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> Given a digraph with 2 nodes the asadpour_atsp  gives the  following exception: ``` File ".../lib/python3.12/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/approximation/traveling_salesman.py", line 440, in asadpour_atsp     raise nx.NetworkXError("G must have at least two nodes") networkx.exception.NetworkXError: G must have at least two nodes ```  That is referring to the following lines: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/86ffe94d62f2ad5f1f26e5b2ed0f5def96e3023e/networkx/algorithms/approximation/traveling_salesman.py#L439-L442 It is obvious that graphs with two nodes get an error that they do not have at least two nodes ### Expected Behavior Expected behavior would be to output the path between the two nodes, not en exception. <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.complete_graph(2, nx.DiGraph) path = nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem(G) ``` <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment ubuntu 24.04 <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.12.3 NetworkX version: 3.4.2
