Lexicographic BFS and chordal graph algorithms#TITLE_END#This PR includes a linear time, O(|V| + |E|), implementation of lexicographic BFS and uses it as a subroutine for chordal graph algorithms. For a chordal graph, the reverse of a lexicographic BFS order is always a perfect elimination order. The following functions are added to `chordal.py`:  1. `reverse_lexBFS_order(G)`, this function returns a dict containing a reverse lexBFS order of the input graph `G` 2. `is_perfect_elim_order(G, order)`, this function returns a boolean indicating whether or not `order` is a perfect elimination order of `G` 3. `perfect_elim_order(G)`, uses `reverse_lexBFS_order` to compute a perfect elimination order, or raises an exception if `G` is not chordal  In addition, the `is_chordal` function has been rewritten to compute an order with `reverse_lexBFS_order` and determine whether or not it is a perfect elimination order by calling `is_perfect_elim_order`. When `G` is not chordal this implementation is about as efficient as the previous one, however when `G` is chordal it is much faster.
