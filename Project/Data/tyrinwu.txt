Cannot create multiedge graph from an adjacency matrix in pandas#TITLE_END#As the author tried in this question in Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48235215/how-to-create-a-directed-networkx-graph-from-a-pandas-adjacency-matrix-dataframe/ only one edge between two nodes is created even I used `G = nx.from_pandas_adjacency(df, nx.MultiGraph())`  Code to reproduce this: ``` df = pd.DataFrame(np.array([[0. , 0.5, 0.5, 0. ],                            [1. , 0. , 0. , 0. ],                            [0.8, 0. , 0. , 0.2],                            [0. , 0. , 1. , 0. ]])) G = nx.from_pandas_adjacency(df, nx.MultiGraph()) print(G.edges(data=True))  # [(0, 1, {'weight': 1.0}), (0, 2, {'weight': 0.8}), (2, 3, {'weight': 1.0})] ```  I am using version 2.0 and Python 3.
