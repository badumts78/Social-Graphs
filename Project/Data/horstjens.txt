issue
bug in documentaiton of read_dot #TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  The usage example at the bottom of "read_dot" ( https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pydot.read_dot.html ) is misleading. It says:  Use `G = nx.Graph(read_dot(path))` to return a Graph instead of a MultiGraph.  should be instead:  Use `G = nx.Graph(nx.nx_pydot.read_dot(path))` to return a Graph instead of a MultiGraph.  I guess the problem is an outdated docstring but my kwnoledge of the github repos is not sufficient to locate it  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> the example does not work, error message is : `NameError: name 'read_dot' is not defined`  ### Expected Behavior no error  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph(read_dot("output_graphviz.dot"))  ```   ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 2.8   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
