issue
JSON exports no longer follow D3's preferred format as of D3 v4#TITLE_END#The D3 [node/link JSON example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045), linked in the documentation, now expects source and target IDs in the link objects that are an attribute of the node objects which you specify when setting up the force-directed graph (e.g. `d.id`). Previously they expected indexes into the node list, you can see the change in the example gist [here](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4062045/revisions?diff=split#diff-8143eda70191fa184211ddbe84974fbdL81).   Should make things simpler for networkx users but assuming `node_link_data` is designed to target d3, the behavior of that should probably change (or at least, the link in the documentation should be taken out until it does).  Related to #2328 as well.
