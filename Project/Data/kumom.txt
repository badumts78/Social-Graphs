issue
Let has_path(G, source, target) return False if either node is not in G#TITLE_END#I am implementing an agent-based model lately and need to maintain a subgraph that is dynamically calculated at each step. So when I was checking whether there exists a path from node v to w by looping through all nodes, v or w might not be in the subgraph.  I was expecting `has_path(G, source, target)` to return `False` if either node is not in the graph, but it raised `NodeNotFound` instead. I looked at the source code and see it is calling `nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)` internally. Can I add a few lines to check the existence of nodes before calling the path finding method?
