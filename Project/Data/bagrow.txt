issue
`nx.info()` no longer informative#TITLE_END#I am the original proposer of `networkx.info()`: #26. Now, `info` provides very little information (see #4139, #4193, #4241). Please consider making `info` give richer output.  *** The use case I envisioned for `info` is a researcher working in IPython who is juggling a couple of different graphs: ``` >>> G.info() Name:                      protein-assay-42 Kind:                      Undirected, Unweighted Number of nodes:           1973 Number of edges:           7695 Average [min, max] degree: 7.80 [1, 200] Number of components:      1  >>> H.info() Name:                      None Kind:                      Undirected, Unweighted Number of nodes:           1973 Number of edges:           1 Average [min, max] degree: 0.0010 [0, 1] Number of components:      1972 ``` _Oh, that's why `H` is weird!_  Such a person may be working to debug a processing script, or wishes to see the results of a filtering method (`Gbefore.info()`, `Gafter.info()`). But these summaries are useful in many ways like keeping records in a log file. (Machine-readable logging should be provided by something like an `asjson=True` option.)  The concerns at the time (16 years ago!) were:  1. Many useful statistics (size of the giant connected component, the number of connected components, ...) are expensive to compute.  2. It's difficult to determine what set of statistics would satisfy everyone. 3. Some information (when or where the network was created) isn't readily accessible.   Despite these concerns, I believe a richer but still reasonable form of `info` can still be a useful part of NetworkX.  ---  Streamlining `info` is great and making `__str__()`, `__repr__()`, etc. more informative is fantastic.  But now `info` is essentially redundant: ``` In [2]: print(G) Graph with 34 nodes and 78 edges  In [3]: print(nx.info(G)) Graph with 34 nodes and 78 edges ```  (And yes, some of the statistics shown by `nx.info` were redundant; the average degree is just a function of the number of nodes and edges. But it is still helpful, glanceable information.)  Please consider returning `info` to the metadata- or data-provenance-focused "prose" version it once was. I believe it is worth the effort to give NetworkX users quick and easy access to such information.
