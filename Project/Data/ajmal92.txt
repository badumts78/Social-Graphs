issue
from_pandas_edgelist does not create weighted graphs despite providing weight column in edge_attrs#TITLE_END#I am using snowflake as my data source. I fetched the contents of a table and wanted to build a directed weighted graph based on the contents of different columns in snowflake table.  Using snowflake connector in python, I was able to fetch the contents of the table as a data frame using   ``` import snowflake.connector ctx = snowflake.connector.connect(     user=username,     password=password,     account=server )  cs = ctx.cursor() G=nx.DiGraph() query = 'select col1, col2, weight from dbo.table ' cs.execute(query)  data_frame = cs.fetch_pandas_all(). ``` I am now trying to provide the data frame as input to  `from_pandas_edgelist(data_frame, source= 'col1', target = 'col2', edge_attr=True, create_using = G)`  Now, after this when I check the graph object created is weighted or not, it returns `False`.   `nx.is_weighted(G) ` How do we provide weights to the edges in from_pandas_edgelist method?  **Environment** Python version : 3.8.10 Network x : 2.6.3
