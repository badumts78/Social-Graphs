Improving Contribution Guidelines#TITLE_END#Hello everyone, I am a newbie to the networkx repository, when following the contribution guidelines I stepped on `pre-commit install` when I ran this command it returned an error because I never had it installed on my computer since I never knew how important it was I did not immediately research on how to install it, but later on I used `pip install pre-commit` before going ahead with `pre-commit install`. I was suggesting that we add `pip install pre-commit` or `conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit`  before adding the command `pre-commit install` @MridulS @rossbar @dschult I will love to get your thoughts on this.  I am using Ubuntu and I don't know if this error was faced by anyone else or not.

Add Examples under distance measures #TITLE_END#The distance measures algorithm currently lacks some examples to show how it works. I will love to work on this by adding examples and also reference an explanatory notebook on `distance measures`.

Hello, @MridulS I will love to work on this issue. I am a newbie here too and I am also willing to learn more, how should the illustration be; should it be something like a jupyter notebook file or how?
comment
Hello, please I will love to update the current documentation for `communities`. To demonstrate how we can use communities in networkx without importing it explicitly.

Hello sir, I have difficulties drawing the spiral layout. IWhen I use ``` G = nx.path_graph(15) daig = nx.spiral_layout(G) nx.drawing.spiral_layout(daig) ```  it does not return an error message but I can't see the diagram, and when I use the next line of code it returns an error. Please sir I need your help. ``` G = nx.path_graph(15) daig = nx.spiral_layout(G) nx.draw_networkx(daig)  ```

Okay sir thanks
