issue
Creation from sparse matrix too slow#TITLE_END#Method 1:  ``` g = nx.from_scipy_sparse_matrix(ppm, edge_attribute='weight') ```  Currently implemented as default when using the Graph constructor. For 1,000 nodes and 39,000 nonzero elements, this takes 1.96 seconds.  Method 2:  ``` nr_persons = ppm.shape[0] g = nx.Graph() g.add_nodes_from(range(nr_persons)) for i in range(nr_persons):     k = [l for l in ppm.indices[ppm.indptr[i]:ppm.indptr[i+1]] if l>=i]     for j in k:         g.add_edge(i,j, weight = ppm[i,j]) ```  For 1,000 nodes and 39,000 nonzero elements, this takes 0.90 seconds.
