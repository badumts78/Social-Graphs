issue
Nondeterminism in simple_cycles()#TITLE_END#`simple_cycles()` has nondeterministic behavior on some graphs. I did not read the paper on Johnson's algorithm, but this issue appears to be implementation-dependent. The exact issue is that while the strongly connected components returned by `strongly_connected_components()` are in a deterministic order, the components themselves are `set`s, which are each iterated over nondeterministically. The code even notes `# order of scc determines ordering of nodes`. This is causing problems in a program that requires deterministic cycle generation to run deterministically itself.  I have two ideas to solve this problem, but both have their downsides: - I have created a temporary workaround by inserting `scc = sorted(scc)` after `scc = sccs.pop()` in `simple_cycles()`. This appears to solve the issue completely, but it requires time for sorting and assumes the nodes are a comparable type. - I believe it's also possible to modify `strongly_connected_components()` to return `list`s instead of `set`s. It would require changing `scc = {v}` to `scc = [v]` and other associated changes within the method. However, this might require additional code to prevent duplicate entries. In addition, code that calls `strongly_connected_components()` but desires the performance of a `set` would have to be modified to manually convert the output.  Neither of these solutions are perfect, but the latter seems less likely to break things. Either way, there will likely be some performance penalty.  I would be happy to work on this fix. It appears simple and I'd like to contribute, but I'm not sure about the best course of action to take. At the very least, if this won't be changed, the documentation should at least include a warning about the nondeterministic implementation.
