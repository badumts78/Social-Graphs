N-Path graphs#TITLE_END#I'd like to jump in to implement a function to calculate N-Path graphs. For a graph `G=(V,E)`, it's n-path graph is `Gn = (V, E')`, where `(c,b)` belongs to `E'` iff there is an path in G with n-steps that connects c and b. If the adjacency matrix for graph `G` is `A`, then, the adjacency matrix for a 2-path graph `G2` is `AA`, and for a 2-path graph `G3` is `AAA`, and so on.  This is more thoroughly defined here: Escalante, F., L. Montejano, and T. Rojano. "Characterization of n-path graphs and of graphs having nth root." Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 16.3 (1974): 282-289.  Also, this can also be used to calculate cocitation, and bibliographic coupling networks.  Is there will in networkx to have this algorithm implemented? I'd do all/most of the work : ) Regards

Hello everyone, so in this case, would there be some sort of a 'Drawer' class that has some methods, and thus people interested in definining 'Drawers' for NetworkX would just need to make a class with these methods? An overview of a drawer class would look like this:  ``` class Drawer:     def draw(G,...):  # Draws the graph         [....] ```  And then, in networkX, we'd just want to be able to set different drawers, and care not about their dependencies:  ``` def set_drawer_class(self,drawer):     self.drawer = drawer [...] def draw(...):     try:         self.drawer.draw(...)     except NameError:         error("No drawer has been defined") # error out if we have no drawer [...] ```  So we'd implement a Drawer class with the matplotlib functionality that we already have... and also fixing the arrow drawing logic. Is this assessment of the necessary work correct?

@hagberg Hi! This seems like something I'd like to tackle in a SoC project. I guess this would mean reimplementing some of these measures to work on networks with link weights different than zero, correct? (e.g. degree of a node, closeness, betweenness, pagerank, shortest paths...), and maybe implementing new ones that are specific for weighted networks. Does this make sense? If you're ok with it, I can start looking into the methods for network measures, and prepare a proposal on making them weight-aware. Any advice or comments here will be welcome!

Hello everyone, I'm quite interested in working with NetworkX for this SoC. I am very interested in graph theory, and I'd like to work on some Graph algorithms. I see that #1076 is already being flirted with by other people, so I'm reading around to see if there's issues where I can help. I'll try to write a draft of a proposal soon. : )

I took a look. Issue #730 seems like a project that can be done over 12 weeks - indeed, it might have a flexible size, as it just consists on expanding existing code, and possibly adding more - in the form of new measures for the network. I everybody is okay with it, I'll start preparing a proposal for this project.  @prasunanand your web application sounds like an interesting project, do you have anything up in github yet? : )
