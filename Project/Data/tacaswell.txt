MNT: make the self-loop appear in all cases#TITLE_END#Previously the logic to add the self-loop (which over-rides theConnectionStyle path!) would only be triggered if the user actually specified a ConnecitonStyle.  This pulls the default from FancyArrowPatch up to draw_networkx_edges.  Follow up to #4360   ```python import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  plt.ion()  G = nx.Graph([('X','Y'), ('X', 'X'), ('Y', 'X')]) pos = nx.spring_layout( G ) nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos,                        nodelist=list(G.nodes)) out = nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos,                              edgelist=list(G.edges),                              style='dashed',                              #connectionstyle="arc3,rad=0.3",                              )  ```  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/199813/99731373-d0fd1600-2a8b-11eb-88f0-4e2cca5a785e.png)   <!-- Please run black to format your code.

API: always use list of FancyArrowPatch rather than LineCollection#TITLE_END#draw_networkx_edges used touse a LineCollection (presumably for performance reasons) when drawing un-directed graphs and generate many FancyArrowPatch objects when drawing directed graphs.  This resulted in issues due to return type instability (#3337) and inconsistency with handling the input (#3398).  closes #3398 closes #3337  Later commit adds ability to draw a self-loop edge. closes #2024 
issue
ENH : if explicitly passed labels draw them by default#TITLE_END#If the user passes in labels as a kwarg, default to drawing them (but don't if `with_labels` is explicitly False).  This is a follow up to the discussion in #936.  Not sure how you want this behavior documented.  I can get rid of the whitespace changes if you want as well.

Draw bug#TITLE_END#The documentation claims that node labels are not drawn.  Modified the plotting code so this is actually true.

doc build broken#TITLE_END#From a clean checkout I ran `python setup.py install` and then I attempted to build a local copy of the docs via `make html` in `doc` and got the following error:  ``` (py2k-base)tcaswell@tcaswellpc1:~/other_source/networkx/doc$ make html mkdir -p build ./make_gallery.py  atlas.pyTraceback (most recent call last):   File "./make_gallery.py", line 57, in <module>     execfile(example)   File "atlas.py", line 59, in <module>     G=atlas6()   File "atlas.py", line 25, in atlas6     Atlas=nx.graph_atlas_g()[0:208] # 208 AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'graph_atlas_g' make: *** [build/generate-stamp] Error 1 ```

Draw return doc#TITLE_END#Went to look up the return types of the `draw_*` functions recently and was annoyed that they were not documented.  This PR also includes PEP8 clean up of `draw_pylab.py` 
comment
Please depend on pytest-mpl not mpl's internal testing tools (we want to be able to change those for our own reasons without worrying about people relying on it!).  We do need to migrate the `check_figures_equal` code to pytest-mpl, if you want that this may be a good motivation to actually do that work.

I don't think that Matplotlib's Collection object have ever been iterable.  Internally we do a fair amount of implicit broadcasting / zipping / colormapping that would be very difficult to keep in sync if we also let users reach in and touch individual elements (the number of notional elements is not ever really fixed if you set the offsets).   It looks like in nx21 (via https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2760) nx changed to sometimes returning a `LineCollection` and sometimes returning a list of `FancyArrowPatch` objects so in some cases you can iterate over the object returned by `draw_networkx_edges` and sometimes not.  Not sure what the best path out of this is though.
