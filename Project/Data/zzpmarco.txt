issue
Red/write weighted edgelist with tuples as nodes#TITLE_END#read_weighted_edgelist after write_weighted_edgelist produces an error  ### Current Behavior  After having created a graph with tuples as nodes and weighted edges (see attachments), I am writing the edgelist to a text file. Subsequent reading attempts fail with exception:  File "[...]\Python3.7\lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\edgelist.py", line 281, in parse_edgelist     f"Edge data {d} and data_keys {data} are not the same length"  ### Expected Behavior  The graph should be read in, normally. Hint: The textual string encoding of tuples (see attachments) does not seem to be correct.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Please execute the python fragment in attachment. txt file produced in the environment below also attached.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.7.9 NetworkX version: 2.6.3  [graph_with_tuples_rw.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/10897544/graph_with_tuples_rw.zip)
