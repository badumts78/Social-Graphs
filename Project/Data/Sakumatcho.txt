BUG: networkx.algorithms.community.kernighan_lin has still randomness even when initial partition is defined#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  Hello netwokx team. This is my very first posting issue. If there is less information, please tell me.  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  When I set the initial partition to `partion` argument in `kernighan_lin_bisection`  function and repeat to call the function by using the same parameters, it sometimes happens that the resulted partition is not reproduced.  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  I expected the resulted partition is reproduced when I configure `partition` argument, because random state is used when the initial partitioning is not cofigured, according to following its docstring: ```     seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)         Indicator of random number generation state.         See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.         Only used if partition is None ```  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ``` import random import networkx as nx from networkx.algorithms.community import kernighan_lin_bisection   seed = 0 random.seed(seed)  G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from([31, 32, 15, 16, 33, 0, 17, 34, 1, 18, 35, 2, 19, 36, 3, 20, 37, 4, 21, 38, 5, 22, 39, 6, 23, 40, 7, 24, 41, 8, 25, 42, 9, 26, 43, 10, 27, 44, 11, 28, 45, 12, 29, 46, 13, 30, 47, 14]) G.add_edges_from([(31, 32, {'weight': 4}), (31, 15, {'weight': 1}), (31, 47, {'weight': 1}), (32, 15, {'weight': 2}), (32, 47, {'weight': 2}), (16, 33, {'weight': 4}), (16, 0, {'weight': 3}), (33, 0, {'weight': 4}), (33, 34, {'weight': 4}), (33, 17, {'weight': 5}), (17, 34, {'weight': 8}), (17, 1, {'weight': 3}), (34, 1, {'weight': 4}), (34, 35, {'weight': 4}), (34, 18, {'weight': 5}), (18, 35, {'weight': 8}), (18, 2, {'weight': 3}), (35, 2, {'weight': 4}), (35, 36, {'weight': 4}), (35, 19, {'weight': 5}), (19, 36, {'weight': 8}), (19, 3, {'weight': 3}), (36, 3, {'weight': 4}), (36, 37, {'weight': 4}), (36, 20, {'weight': 5}), (20, 37, {'weight': 8}), (20, 4, {'weight': 3}), (37, 4, {'weight': 4}), (37, 38, {'weight': 4}), (37, 21, {'weight': 5}), (21, 38, {'weight': 8}), (21, 5, {'weight': 3}), (38, 5, {'weight': 4}), (38, 39, {'weight': 4}), (38, 22, {'weight': 5}), (22, 39, {'weight': 8}), (22, 6, {'weight': 3}), (39, 6, {'weight': 4}), (39, 40, {'weight': 4}), (39, 23, {'weight': 5}), (23, 40, {'weight': 8}), (23, 7, {'weight': 3}), (40, 7, {'weight': 4}), (40, 41, {'weight': 4}), (40, 24, {'weight': 5}), (24, 41, {'weight': 8}), (24, 8, {'weight': 3}), (41, 8, {'weight': 4}), (41, 42, {'weight': 4}), (41, 25, {'weight': 5}), (25, 42, {'weight': 8}), (25, 9, {'weight': 3}), (42, 9, {'weight': 4}), (42, 43, {'weight': 4}), (42, 26, {'weight': 5}), (26, 43, {'weight': 8}), (26, 10, {'weight': 3}), (43, 10, {'weight': 4}), (43, 44, {'weight': 4}), (43, 27, {'weight': 5}), (27, 44, {'weight': 8}), (27, 11, {'weight': 3}), (44, 11, {'weight': 4}), (44, 45, {'weight': 4}), (44, 28, {'weight': 5}), (28, 45, {'weight': 8}), (28, 12, {'weight': 3}), (45, 12, {'weight': 4}), (45, 46, {'weight': 4}), (45, 29, {'weight': 5}), (29, 46, {'weight': 8}), (29, 13, {'weight': 3}), (46, 13, {'weight': 4}), (46, 47, {'weight': 4}), (46, 30, {'weight': 5}), (30, 47, {'weight': 8}), (30, 14, {'weight': 3}), (47, 14, {'weight': 4})])  for i in range(10):     A0 = [0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29, 31, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43]     B0 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 36, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47]     part1, part2 = kernighan_lin_bisection(G, partition=(A0, B0), weight='weight')     print(part1, part2) ```  Output: ``` {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} {2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43} {2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} {2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40} {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47} ```  This graph `G` is my specific weighted graph. But you can seed the resulted partitions, `part1` and `part2`, are sometimes not reproduced.  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.12.4 NetworkX version: 3.3  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->  In my understanding, `seed.shuffle(labels)` is always executed, even if the initial partition is configured. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/community/kernighan_lin.py#L98  But, I am wondering my assumption might be wrong, and current codes and specification might be correct. Therefore, I would like to clarify the specification of this fuction first.  Thanks.
