communicability_betweenness_centrality error (probably matrix/vector dimension error)#TITLE_END#Hello everyone, I'm trying to compute the communicability_betweenness_centrality for a Barabási-Albert graph, with the following code (networkx version 1.11, python3):  ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(1000, 3) c_bet = nx.communicability_betweenness_centrality(G) ```  However, it raises the following error:  ```python /home/zr/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scipy/sparse/linalg/matfuncs.py in _rmatvec(self, x)     201         x = x.ravel()     202         for i in range(self._p): --> 203             x = A_T.dot(x)     204         return x     205   ValueError: shapes (1000,1000) and (1,1000) not aligned: 1000 (dim 1) != 1 (dim 0) ``` I did the same thing with the karate club network and it worked normally.   Thank you.
