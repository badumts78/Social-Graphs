reminded me once again to be mindful when allowing my direct dependency chain to roll across a major version without second thought.  I suppose I should have always had decorator<5 in my requirements, same with the rest of them.   While this one seems to be a departure from _expected_ behavior, I suppose they're allowed to introduce whatever backward incompatibility they want across a major tick.

maybe so, or maybe python tracks parameters not making sense semantically is the problem we are the ones relying on undocumented behavior.    the maintainer had the good sense to know to bump major revision and my default assumption should have been major revisions aren't drop-ins.  Like I said, most of the responsibility is on me not thinking to pin to decorator<5 and pin to every other dependency to a known good major revision.    Live and learn every day.  Seems like python still has fewer of these oops major rev updates than some of our peer scripting languages, so I guess that's good.
