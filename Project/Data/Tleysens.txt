issue
Possible syntax error in gml.py (readwrite)#TITLE_END#https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/e3566e53793cdccc19a8c2ff9c056e0d7b524634/networkx/readwrite/gml.py#L680  I've got an error when I want to write a .gml file from a network using the write_gml() function. At line 680 there is "test" instead of "text" I think.
