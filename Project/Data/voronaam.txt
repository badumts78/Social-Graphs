barabasi_albert_graph does not start off with a connected network#TITLE_END#`barabasi_albert_graph` starts with `G=empty_graph(m)` instead of `G = complete_graph(m)`. As a result, the early new nodes are almost certain to become hubs, since the distribution is heavily skewed in their favour. The initial `m` nodes have almost zero chance to be a hub.  To reproduce: ``` hubs = [] for i in range(100):     G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(1000,500)     hubs.append(sorted(G, key=lambda n: len(G[n]), reverse=True)[0]) count_dict={} for hub in hubs:     count_dict[hub]=hubs.count(hub) print ('\nfrequency:\t',count_dict)  # prints # frequency:	 {500: 34, 501: 27, 502: 13, 503: 10, 504: 11, 505: 2, 506: 3} ```  The first new node (500) has the highest chance of becoming the hub. This is not random enough.  Quote from Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model ): > The network begins with an initial connected network of m_0 nodes.   And logically it has to start from a connected network for the initial `m` nodes to have a chance to be a hub.  The effect would not be noticeable in "small world" kind of networks (medium node degree << number of nodes) but is profound in networks with n and m close enough to each other.
