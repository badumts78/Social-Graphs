Small documentation error in clustering coefficient for weighted networks#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  The networkx documenation gives the following formula for the clustering coefficient for unweighted directed networks:  https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cluster.clustering.html#networkx.algorithms.cluster.clustering  _Picture from networkx documenation_ ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31069329/212475513-479dec63-1dc9-4159-a83a-fb6da763b9c6.png)  Please note the factor 2 in the numerator.  In the original publication the equation is the following:   _Picture from original publication_ ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31069329/212475588-c43829cb-a819-4fad-8b50-ef3db1d02be1.png) Please note the factor 2 in the denominator.  I checked the implementation and there it seems to be correct [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/59f5b01c80064b3b88e1d044bab1c4cf61fdbc85/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py#L376) (great work to whoever made it so easy to compare it to the equation from the original publication 🎉 )  ```python t / ((dt * (dt - 1) - 2 * db) * 2) ``` Please note the factor two in the denominator.    ### Expected Behavior I think the equation in the documentation should be updated so that the 2 is in the denominator.
