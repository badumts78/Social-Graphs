issue
NetworkX read_edgelist() dropping nodes and edges from tsv input file#TITLE_END#Hello,  I am trying to load a fairly large graph (16M edges) with NetworkX. The edge file can be found here: http://genomics.lbl.gov/~marcin/merged_edges_simple.tsv.gz  This is the code to reproduce the issue:  g = nx.read_edgelist(input_file, nodetype=str, data=(('weight', int),), create_using=nx.Graph()) print("[INFO] Number of nodes:{} and number of edges: {}.".format(len(g.nodes()), len(g.edges())), flush=True)  This produces the following output: Number of nodes:336359 and number of edges: 10292807.  However, the input tsv file has more edges and nodes, namely: - 16173904 edges based on wc of the input file (this includes ~1000 redundant edges per 'sort | uniq') - 451237 nonredundant nodes  For some reason about 6M edges are being lost and over 100k nodes, when the data is loaded by NetworkX. My best hunch is this may be because of odd characters in node labels? Is there anything else that could lead to this behavior?  This is using NetworkX 2.4 and python 3.7.   many thanks, marcin
