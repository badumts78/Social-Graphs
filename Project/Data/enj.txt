maximal_independent_set does not work for DiGraph#TITLE_END#Currently [maximal_independent_set](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/d7d906e1d16ef331da0bc1d149953e7532155acc/networkx/algorithms/mis.py#L70) returns the wrong results for a `DiGraph` because it uses the `G.neighbors` method which returns only the successor nodes in a `DiGraph`.  I believe the [all_neighbors](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/13b373bf6938c077d1e61adc60a48cb910a75755/networkx/classes/function.py#L540) function should be used instead to make `maximal_independent_set` work correctly for both graph types.

Issues calculating max independent set#TITLE_END#`Python 2.7.11` `networkx 1.11`  I have the following directed acyclic graph:  ![DAG](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7001223/15185853/c0cba98a-1768-11e6-9ef4-ae6f87dd59e4.png)  I wanted to calculate the max independent set of the transitive closure of this DAG (the nodes colored in green).  ``` python from networkx import Graph, DiGraph, transitive_closure from networkx.algorithms.bipartite import hopcroft_karp_matching, to_vertex_cover  # Build the DAG G = DiGraph() G.add_edge("A", "C") G.add_edge("A", "B") G.add_edge("C", "E") G.add_edge("C", "D") G.add_edge("E", "G") G.add_edge("E", "F") G.add_edge("G", "I") G.add_edge("G", "H")  tc = transitive_closure(G) btc = Graph()  # Create a bipartite graph based on the transitive closure of G for v in tc.nodes_iter():     btc.add_node((0, v))     btc.add_node((1, v))  for u, v in tc.edges_iter():     btc.add_edge((0, u), (1, v))  matching = hopcroft_karp_matching(btc) vertex_cover = to_vertex_cover(btc, matching) independent_set = set(G) - {v for _, v in vertex_cover} ```  I am expecting independent set to be `set(['B', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'H'])` but it is `set(['A', 'B', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'H'])` instead.  I am either doing something wrong, or there is a bug in the `to_vertex_cover` function.

A minimum vertex cover is the complement of a maximum independent set for any graph
