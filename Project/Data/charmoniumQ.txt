One reason to prefer inline types is to make generic type work in casts.  With out-of-line stubs:  ``` >>> from __future__ import annotations >>> from typing import cast >>> import networkx as nx >>> a: nx.Graph[int]  = ... # this type annotation gets ignored >>> b = cast(nx.Graph[int], ...) # this type annotation gets evaluated because it is in the position of a value Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable ```  With in-line annotations:  ``` >>> b = cast(nx.Graph[int], ...) ```  Because the networkx source code would read`class Graph(Generic[Node]): ...`.  This came up for me while casting a `Graph[A | B]` to a `Graph[A]` in the case where I had tested that none of the nodes were `B`.  However, there are workarounds for out-of-line stubs. Either each user writes [this workaround](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/runtime_troubles.html#using-classes-that-are-generic-in-stubs-but-not-at-runtime) or the library can write: ```     def __class_getitem__(self, _): return self ```

Thanks for the continuing guidance, @dschult. Also thanks for the initial type stubs @fmagin and @NeilGirdhar.  I believe the most complete stub files are currently [here](https://github.com/fmagin/networkx-stubs). The stubs are imprecise, as most functions are just typed to `Any`, but even that is quite useful because mypy can statically check that you spelled the names of functions correctly and got their arity right.  I will try to merge those stub files into the main repository (not modifying existing code) tonight.

While I agree with @danieleades, I think @dschult has been pretty clear that the networkx core team is willing to consider out-of-line stubs right now and will potentially consider in-line annotations in the future. I'd rather have out-of-line stubs than nothing. Library users would not notice a huge difference.

>> Having stubs in separate files makes it difficult to reason about how to edit or improve stub files. Tooling to check for consistency does exist, but that'll run in CI, and won't have IDE support. In short, this will have a chilling effect on typing contributions > > I am also more in favor of inline than stub annotations, but given that the core team is willing to do stubs, why not start there?  That's my motivation for #5886. Maybe some day in the future, the stubs can get inlined, and we'll all be happy then, but writing stubs in-repo is the baby-step in the right direction.

@NeilGirdhar is this needed for the type annotations PR (#4014)?  It seems to me it was needed at one point, when that PR tried to deduplicate code in the constructor but is not needed any longer.
