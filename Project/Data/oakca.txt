issue
`network_simplex()` function gives overflow warning with integers for weights and demand#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior overflow warning on `network_simplex()` function, eventhough using the integer values for edges weight and demand  ### Expected Behavior no overflow warning and calculate the result  ### Steps to Reproduce I am using a `directed_graph` and try to calculate the `network_simplex(directed_graph)`. If you could somehow tell me how to save a directed graph and send it to you, I would gladly do. So you could reproduce it. By the way, this function works with bigger graphs without the overflow warning. So I don't really understand what causing this issue.  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: `Python 3.7.9 (tags/v3.7.9:13c94747c7, Aug 17 2020, 18:58:18) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]` NetworkX version: `2.5`  ### Additional context Here you may find more information: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70870774/networkx-network-simplex-function-overflow-warning-without-floating-numbers
