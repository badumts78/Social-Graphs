What is the proper way to create a networkx 1.x style subgraph?#TITLE_END#Hello,  First of all, I would like to thank you for your continuous effort, that you put into this library. The constant flow of improvements and new features, along with a great quality of code and documentation, are really impressive!  The last major version of the *networkx* package has brought us a great amount of cool features and ideas, with the `SubGraph` class among them, which is here a particular subject of interest.   If I understand correctly, the `SubGraph` was designed to represent a sort of a live view over it's parent graph. The *liveness* here is achieved through the usage of a various node and edge filters, which tells the subgraph of what particular nodes and edges should be included in the view.  However, one might encounter a case, where the usage of *old-style* subgraphs are more preferable, due to speed considerations. Thus, here is the question about what is the proper way to create a netoworkx 1.x style subgraph? During my works, I've came up with the following solution:   ```python def old_style_subgraph(G, nbunch):     """     Make a subgraph of `G`, which consist only of nodes in `nbunch`.     """     H = G.fresh_copy()     H.add_edges_from(nx.induced_subgraph(G, nbunch).edges(keys=True, data=True))     return H ```  But I wonder, if there is a more nice and clean way to do this?  Thank you in advance!
