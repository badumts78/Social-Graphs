floyd_warshall_numpy appears broken#TITLE_END#The following code produces the wrong result:  ``` python import networkx as nx g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_node(0) g.add_node(1) g.add_weighted_edges_from([(0,1,1)]) nx.floyd_warshall_numpy(g) ```  This is the (wrong) result:  ``` python     matrix([[ 0.,  1.],                 [ 1.,  0.]]) ```  Here is the heart of the problem (from floyd_warshall_numpy):  ``` python     for i in range(n):         A = np.minimum(A, A[i,:] + A[:,i]) ```  And this is a simple fix:  ``` python     for k in xrange(n):         A = np.minimum(A, A[np.newaxis,k,:] + A[:,k,np.newaxis])  ```  The author must have thought that the code adds a row vector to a column vector, which by NumPy's broadcasting rules should produce a matrix. But A[i,:] and A[:,i] are one-dimensional vectors, thus no broadcasting is performed and the addition produces a vector.
