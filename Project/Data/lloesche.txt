Introduction of circular reference in 2.8.1#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  Between NetworkX 2.8 and 2.8.1 a new behaviour was introduced that is still present in 2.8.8. Whether or not this is considered a bug is up for debate, but it caused one of our tests to fail when the behaviour changed in the minor version.  Since 2.8.1 the refcount to a graph is permanently increased after calling `number_of_edges()` on it. In 2.8 this function did not have any side-effect.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` In [1]: from sys import getrefcount  In [2]: from networkx import DiGraph  In [3]: g = DiGraph()  In [4]: getrefcount(g) Out[4]: 2  In [5]: g.number_of_edges() Out[5]: 0  In [6]: getrefcount(g) Out[6]: 3 ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version: 2.8.8  ### Additional context  For context, we are using NetworkX in our project and have a class `Graph` that inherits `MultiDiGraph` as well as a `GraphExportIterator` that's passed a `Graph` and calls amongst other things `number_of_edges()` in its `__init__` method.  In 2.8 the object graph in our project was as followed: ![networkx-2 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2124094/203679254-3631bfe7-a0be-4bbf-bb05-1c890bd43e69.png)  Now in 2.8.8 it looks like this: ![networkx-2 8 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2124094/203679313-c79843fa-041c-4cd5-ae19-3d718354924f.png)  Which means when the graph is dereferenced it's no longer immediately removed based on refcount but has to wait for the garbage collector.  If this is expected behaviour just close the issue.

In Pajek export add extra information when casting 'id' to int() fails.#TITLE_END#Resolves #3910 Tested with Python 2.7 and 3.8 Preserves the original error message and adds the extra information as an additional argument.

Pajek export assumes Graph node's id attribute to be int castable#TITLE_END#In pajek export it reads https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/b0ca6ce081cc6e66d509c5f7fed60728da821c25/networkx/readwrite/pajek.py#L57  I was wondering, since NetworkX supports arbitrary Python objects as Graph nodes where does the assumption come from that a node's `id` attribute is `int` castable? An objects `id` attribute would have nothing to do with Python's builtin `id()`. But I'm not familiar with the Pajek file format so don't know about the relevance and special treatment of `id` in it.  I was working with a Graph whose node's `id` attribute happened to be a string. For it Pajek export failed with ``` ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'arn:aws:iam::579763146468:role/aws-service-role/trustedadvisor.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForTrustedAdvisor' ```
