How can I guarantee that subgraphs from kernighan_lin algorithm are contiguous?#TITLE_END#I am using the [Kernighan-Lin algorithm ](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/6e20b952a957af820990f68d9237609198088816/networkx/algorithms/community/kernighan_lin.py)to bisect my graph.  Is there a way to specify that the subgraphs are all necessarily fully connected (contiguous), or is there some other algorithm that will bisect a graph subject to the constraint that the child subgraphs are fully connected?  For example, the script pasted at the bottom of this post generates a simple 4-node "star" graph with one central node (Node 1) connected to 3 other nodes.  By default, the KL algorithm splits it into 2 subgraphs, each with 2 nodes.  Since all edges connect to Node 1, the KL algorithm keeps nodes 1 and 4 connected, but breaks nodes 2 and 3 which end up as singletons, since the parent graph had no 2-3 edge.  This is shown in the "default" pictures.  I would prefer that the algorithm instead break off a single node in order to avoid a broken subgraph, as in the "contiguous" pictures.  Does anyone have any ideas on this?   Thanks for your help.       ![stardefault](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26798426/24516653/4ebe05ec-1530-11e7-9151-6894f8ea81ff.png) ![starcontiguous](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26798426/24516658/564a8498-1530-11e7-9569-e2b097fe489e.png)   # 4-node Star Graph Example script import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import kernighan_lin  # build parent graph G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge(1,2) G.add_edge(1,3) G.add_edge(1,4)  # use Kernighan-Lin with default setting to split into children C1,C2 = kernighan_lin.kernighan_lin_bisection(G) D1 = nx.subgraph(G,C1) D2 = nx.subgraph(G,C2)  # plot the parent and default child graphs plt.figure(1) plt.subplot(3,1,1) nx.draw_networkx(G) plt.title("Parent Graph")  plt.subplot(3,1,2) nx.draw_networkx(D1) plt.title("Child 1 Graph, default")  plt.subplot(3,1,3) nx.draw_networkx(D2) plt.title("Child 2 Graph, default")  # manually create the subgraph I want, which are contiguous E1 = nx.subgraph(G,{1,3,4}) E2 = nx.subgraph(G,{2})  # plot the parent and manually created contiguous subgraphs plt.figure(2) plt.subplot(3,1,1) nx.draw_networkx(G) plt.title("Parent Graph")  plt.subplot(3,1,2) nx.draw_networkx(E1) plt.title("Child 1 Graph, contiguous")  plt.subplot(3,1,3) nx.draw_networkx(E2) plt.title("Child 2 Graph, contiguous")
