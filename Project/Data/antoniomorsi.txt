issue
Steiner tree approximation does not iteratively remove nonterminal leaves#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> The last step in both steiner tree approximation algorithms ("mehlhorn and "kou" are effected) from [steinertree.py](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/approximation/steinertree.py) is to remove nonterminal leave nodes from the graph. It's implemented in the function `_remove_nonterminal_leaves`. Within `_remove_nonterminal_leaves` nonterminal leaves should be iteratively removed until no more nonterminal leaves exist. Currently only the nonterminal leaves are removed, but this might yield to further nonterminal leaves.  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> The non terminal leaves are not removed iteratively, see implementation:  ```python def _remove_nonterminal_leaves(G, terminals):     terminals_set = set(terminals)     for n in list(G.nodes):         if n not in terminals_set and G.degree(n) == 1:             G.remove_node(n) ```  ### Expected Behavior The nonterminal leaves should be removed iteratively - not only once - e.g., in a loop. An example implementation (maybe not the most efficient one) could be:  ```python def _remove_nonterminal_leaves_iteratively(G, terminals):     terminals_set = set(terminals)     while True:         non_terminal_leaves = [n for n in G.nodes if n not in terminals_set and G.degree(n) == 1]         if not non_terminal_leaves:             break         G.remove_nodes_from(non_terminal_leaves) ```  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  It's not obvious to reproduce this bug with a small example when calling the steiner_tree functions. I have huge graphs where this bug occurs quite often. But it's easy to trigger this when using the effected wrong implementation `_remove_nonterminal_leaves` directly.    <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ```python import networkx as nx from networkx.algorithms.approximation.steinertree import _remove_nonterminal_leaves  G = nx.Graph() G.add_edges_from([(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)], weight=1) G.edges  # prints EdgeView([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)])  _remove_nonterminal_leaves(G, [1,2]) G.edges  # prints EdgeView([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])  _remove_nonterminal_leaves(G, [1,2]) G.edges  # prints EdgeView([(1, 2), (2, 3)])  _remove_nonterminal_leaves(G, [1,2]) G.edges  # prints EdgeView([(1, 2)]) finally the correct result without further nonterminal leaves ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> This is a bug in the current latest source code (main or tag: networkx-3.1).   Python version: 3.11.4 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
