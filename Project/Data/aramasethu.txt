Docstrings for the small.py module#TITLE_END#Added docstrings in small.py with `Description`, `Parameters`, `Returns`, `References`  sections explaining the graphs.  Fixes #5213

Hi,   I have started working on this issue. I noticed that the `LCF_graph` function's docstring has all the details that you have specified in the issue. Can use the same format for rest of the functions?

Hi this is an example of the doc string for bull graph: ``` """     Creates a bull graph with 5 nodes and 5 edges.     "... the bull graph is a planar undirected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges,           in the form of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges" [1]      Parameters     ----------     create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.      Returns     -------     G : networkx Graph         A bull graph with 5 nodes      References     ----------     .. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_graph.      """ ```  Let me know if this looks okay.

Hi,   I have added the docstrings to all the graphs (starting from bull graph). I have linked the PR to this issue. Please let me know what your feedback is.   Thanks for your help
