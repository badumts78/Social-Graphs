strongly_connected_components too slow: quadratic run time for some graphs#TITLE_END#nx.strongly_connected_components(dg) is prohibitively slow for certain graphs.  For example, the code below shows approximately quadratic run time for a very simple non-cyclic DAG having one start node linking to each of N intermediate nodes each linking to an end node.  SCC should run in O(num_nodes + num_edges) using Tarjan's algorithm.  I ran into this in a practical problem (with a much more complex graph) where SCC computation using networkx just seemed to hang for some graphs.  Tested with Python 3.5.2, networkx 2.0 (installed with pip3 install networkx on Jan 13, 2018).  Here's the test code: ``` import time import networkx as nx for count in range(10000, 100000, 10000):     # Create the graph     dg = nx.DiGraph()     dg.add_node(0)  # Start node     dg.add_node(1)  # End node     # Add intermediate nodes and their edges     for i in range(2, count):         dg.add_node(i)  # Add intermediate node         dg.add_edge(0, i)  # From start node to intermediate         dg.add_edge(i, 1)  # From intermediate to end node     # Time finding strongly connected components     t = time.time()     ret = tuple(nx.strongly_connected_components(dg))     print("with {} nodes: {} secs".format(count, time.time() - t)) ```
