issue
is_connected is not implemented for directed graphs#TITLE_END#Python version: 3.6.0 nx version: 2.1  Simplest example:  ``` import networkx as nx  vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4] edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]  g = nx.DiGraph() for edge in edges:     g.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])  print(nx.is_connected(g)) ```  What should happen:  Output:  > True  What does happen:   > Traceback (most recent call last): >   File "digraph.py", line 10, in <module> >     print(nx.is_connected(g)) >   File "<decorator-gen-108>", line 2, in is_connected >   File "/Users/daniel_kats/prog/cloud-trail-log-parsing/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 71, in _not_implemented_for >     raise nx.NetworkXNotImplemented(msg) > networkx.exception.NetworkXNotImplemented: not implemented for directed type  Would be very useful if someone implemented this
