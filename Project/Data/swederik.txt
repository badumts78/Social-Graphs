Knotty Centrality by Shanahan and Wildie#TITLE_END#Hello!  This is an implementation of the Knotty Centrality measure by Murray Shanahan and Mark Wildie. I have ported it from their MATLAB code in the hopes of getting it into NetworkX.  "Attempts to find the sub-graph of G with the highest value for knotty-centrality. Carries out a series of exhaustive searches on subsets of the nodes ranked by "indirect" betweenness centrality, then carries out a phase of hill-climbing to see whether the sub-graph can be improved by adding further nodes."  The relevant reference is here:  Shanahan M, Wildie M (2012) Knotty-Centrality: Finding the Connective Core of a Complex Network.     PLoS ONE 7(5): e36579. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036579   http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036579#pone.0036579.s003  and it returns results similar to the rich club coefficient.  UPDATE: I can now confirm that this works as intended...   Testing script and data can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/irsau7ojcgtv3z9/ZZvOfckfEX
