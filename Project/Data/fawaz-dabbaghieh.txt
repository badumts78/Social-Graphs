Unexpected results from Kernighan-Lin algorithm, also compared to another implementation#TITLE_END#Hi, I was trying to bisect a graph using the Kernighan-Lin algorithm implemented in Networkx. I have been testing on relatively simple graphs but the partitions I'm getting are quite random which doesn't make sense for a simple graph like that with the KL algorithm. To test my theory, I tried another implementation of the same algorithm, namely [this one](https://github.com/mcavus/Kernighan-Lin), and the results given are much more stable or at least what is expected from the KL algorithm.  Looking at the screen shots below (made by a tool called Bandage for drawing genomic graphs). You can see how the results from the KL algorithm using Networkx seems somewhat random and not expected compared to the other implementation.  I can provide the codes if needed, but all I'm doing is simply loading the graph, calling `community.kernighan_lin_bisection` on the graph then giving each partition a color.  Please let me know if I can provide any more information.  ![Netowrkx_implementation_KL](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/23493178/e26b50e9-4296-42f2-8d0a-2bef0d58b80b) ![mcavus_implementation_KL](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/assets/23493178/4ba6a19d-b2db-4187-8f9b-cacda5ac0927)  P.S: I have tried other community algorithms implemented by networks and the results are more aligned to what is expected of the algorithm to do. E.g. using `greedy_modularity_communities` or using the, eignevector route with `nx.linalg.algebraicconnectivity.fiedler_vector`.
