Came here to write an issue about this.  To the reader: Note the difference between `G.edges()` (the function) and `G.edges` (the property).  What makes  `G.edges()` yielding tuples extremely frustrating is when you want to access all edges in / outbound of a specific node. Basically, what I want to do is this: ```python for u, v, node_id in G.out_edges(node):   ... ``` But that is not possible since `G.edges()` yields tuples, and as far as I understand there is no way of getting edges connected to a specific node from `G.edges`.  So what I end up doing is this: ```python >>> def get_out_edges(graph: Union[nx.MultiGraph,nx.MultiDiGraph], node: int) -> Generator[Tuple[int, int, int], None, None]: ...     for succ in graph.successors(node): ...         for edge_id in graph[node][succ]: ...             yield node, succ, edge_id ... >>> list(get_out_edges(G, 2)) [(2, 4, 0), (2, 5, 0), (2, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1)] ``` I think that an elegant solution would be adding a kwarg to `Multi(Di)Graph.edges()`, `.in_edges()` and `.out_edges()`  to get triples instead of tuples which is `False` by default for backwards compatibility.  To illustrate: ```python >>> G.edges(2) OutMultiEdgeDataView([(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 2), (2, 2)]) >>> G.edges(2, with_ids=True) OutMultiEdgeDataView([(2, 4, 0), (2, 5, 0), (2, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1)]) ```
