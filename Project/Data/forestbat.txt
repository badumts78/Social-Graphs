issue
Amount of nodes and edges have mistakes when reading adjlist file#TITLE_END#I wrote this code： `nx.write_adjlist(network_graph, 'network_graph.adjlist')` And debug info is like this：  > DiGraph with 269 nodes and 244 edges (Correct amount）  However when I read the same adjlist file like this： `network_graph = nx.read_adjlist('network_graph.adjlist')` debug info told me：  > Graph with 429 nodes and 723 edges（Wrong amount）  And I can't find useful information from the wrong graph，so why it will happen and how I can solve it？ This is my adjlist file：https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/QFBNqshqsj/
issue
AttributeError: module 'backend_interagg' has no attribute 'FigureCanvas'#TITLE_END#I want to print picture of my digraph: `nx.draw_networkx(upstream_graph, node_size=10)`  However it crashed like this: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/yt5pCpKkVX/  My version of networkx is 2.8.6, and version of matplotlib is 3.6.0. I think this is not my problem,so please fix or help me resolve this problem.
