issue
Load graph from pandas dataframe as adjacency matrix#TITLE_END#As of now, [nx.from_pandas_dataframe](http://networkx.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference/generated/networkx.convert_matrix.from_pandas_dataframe.html) assumes that the data is oriented in some sort of table kind of form. However, it would also be advantageous to accept pandas dataframes oriented as some sort of adjacency matrix, such as [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21210849/2014591).  At the current moment, [from_numpy_matrix](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.7/reference/generated/networkx.convert.from_numpy_matrix.html) is the way to construct a graph using an adjacency matrix. However, the matrix doesn't have the nodes labeled, and the current way to label the nodes is the method described in the above stackoverflow post.  How does a function like `from_pandas_adjacency_matrix` sound? 
issue
write_gml should raise warning or errors when booleans / invalid characters are written#TITLE_END#The following lines of code don't work, due to GML specifications [here](http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/index.php?id=17297&L=1).   ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_node(1, attr_dict={"small": True}) nx.write_gml(G, "small.gml") nx.read_gml("small.gml") ```  `read_gml` currently cannot parse the output file, because the output does not treat True (or any boolean values) as an ascii string:  In `small.gml`:  ``` graph [   directed 1   node [     id 0     label 1     small True   ] ] ```  I think the `nx.write_gml(G, "small.gml")` should raise a warning if boolean values are written to an output file. In any case, some notification to a user that boolean values will not be able to be written correctly is preferable.  Related: #1386. This mentions that you cannot write underscores in GML. 
issue
Pagerank algorithms should verify that personalization is non-negative#TITLE_END#We should raise an Error when input pageranks are negative, and check when each personalization is zero.  Example:  ``` >>> import networkx as nx >>> G = nx.DiGraph() >>> G.add_nodes_from("ABCD") >>> G.add_edges_from([("A", "B"), ("B", "D"), ("D", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("A", "C")]) >>> """ The graph network  (A) ----> (B) ----> (D)    \      /     \   /      (C) """ >>> nx.pagerank(G) {'A': 0.09985962280170124,  'B': 0.35566461384457854,  'C': 0.2934581626557564,  'D': 0.25101760069796386} >>> nx.pagerank(G, personalization={"A": 1, "B": 1, "C": 1, "D": 1}) {'A': 0.09985962280170124,  'B': 0.35566461384457854,  'C': 0.2934581626557564,  'D': 0.25101760069796386} >>> # The next calculation is invalid, but it doesn't catch it >>> nx.pagerank(G, personalization={"A": 1, "B": -1, "C": -1, "D": -1}) {'A': -0.21266619043527665,  'B': 0.4744408497018217,  'C': 0.3239210217246239,  'D': 0.4143043190088311} >>> nx.pagerank(G, personalization={"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": 0, "D": 0}) ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero ```  For the last case, I've also seen the situation when the pagerank reaches 100 iterations (it doesn't converge).  I would like to work on this PR, if this issue is approved. 
comment
Until I looked up online why my `write_gml` wasn't working, I was confused why I couldn't write nodes that had underscores in them.  Can we add to the documentation that graph, node, and edge attributes cannot have underscores when writing using `write_gml`? 
comment
Good suggestion, @hagberg.  @chebee7i, are you still interested in working on this PR? Can you add this to the list of things to fix?
