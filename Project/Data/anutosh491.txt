Fixes equidistant parameter for spiral layout whenever passed as True explicitly#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  Fixes #5211   **Brief description of the change**  Just by simple `print` statements between lines  as shown below, I could figure out that the measurements for the first node were off by some account , leading to the error  ```         for _ in range(len(G)):             print(theta)             r = step * theta             print(r)             theta += chord / r             pos.append([np.cos(theta) * r, np.sin(theta) * r]) ``` The values of `theta` and `r` obtained on master are when number of node are `6` are as follows ``` theta = [0.175, 3.032142857142857, 3.1970427393572267, 3.353437270417054, 3.50253801680967, 3.6452916422094113] r = [8.220459030036954, 0.9679057090890294, 0.9707783270266445, 0.9731756361695102, 0.975206931979123, 0.9769503470399769] ``` The differences are quite obvious as the first node stands out . Now this was happening because some computations being done from the second node wasn't being done for the first . Hence adding `theta += chord / (step * theta)` does it for us .We can see that the computations for the (n + 1)th node are now computations for the nth node  ``` theta = [3.032142857142857, 3.1970427393572267, 3.353437270417054, 3.50253801680967, 3.6452916422094113, 3.7824548788104067] r = [0.9679057090890294, 0.9707783270266445, 0.9731756361695102, 0.975206931979123, 0.9769503470399769 0.9784632205154521] # we can see the above arrays are shifted forms of the arrays reported previously . Hence this ensures the computations of the # first node is being done properly  ``` Some results  1) **when nodes are 5** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052487/155131125-560c13ab-f071-4379-9c2a-1eafeba603e8.png) 2) **when nodes are 10** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052487/155131303-4cdab2dc-92f3-4afd-8221-abc54fad3091.png) 3) **when nodes are 100** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052487/155131424-f118618e-6a4a-4b52-a885-b6363275060c.png) **The last result on master** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052487/155131512-17215c55-961b-4882-bc6c-0c12013d139a.png)

Fixed inconsistent documentation for nbunch parameter in DiGraph.edges()#TITLE_END#Closes #4985  On going through the code ,I found that the "nbunch" parameter has been used more than a couple of times and the description for all of those was misleading . Hence I have fixed the description of each of those as required.

Hey @dschult ,as no one seems to be working on this can I take this up . I am a beginner at open source and this seems to be an approachable issue!
