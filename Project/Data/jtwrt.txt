Bipartite Closeness centrality algorithm does not report nodes with zero value.#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior The function saves closeness values of '0.0' always at closeness[len(nodes)] which is closeness[n]. This results a returned dictionary with less elements than number of nodes in the graph.  ### Expected Behavior The values of '0.0' should instead be saved at closeness[node] within the for-loops iterating over all nodes.  ### Steps to Reproduce /  ### Environment Python version: 3.9.12 NetworkX version: 2.8   ### Additional context In both cases within the source code below `else:             closeness[n] = 0. ` needs to be changed to: `else:             closeness[node] = 0. ` See sourcecode: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/bipartite/centrality.html#closeness_centrality
