issue
`get_edge_data` returns dict of dicts when called on multidirectional graph#TITLE_END#I have the following code to demonstrate the issue: ``` import networkx as nx  graph = nx.Graph() mgraph =  nx.MultiDiGraph()  for G in [graph, mgraph]:     G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.7)  print(graph.get_edge_data(1, 2)) print(mgraph.get_edge_data(1,2)) ```  Running the above results in : ``` {'weight': 4.7} {0: {'weight': 4.7}} ```  The second printed statement shows a dict of dicts which is very confusing to me. Since both graphs have exactly the same attributes, how is it that the results are different? What does the 0 key represent in the MultiDiGraph?
