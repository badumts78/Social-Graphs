issue
is_isomorphic very slow on some graphs#TITLE_END#is_isomorphic gets stuck in a loop for comparison of several of our graphs. I have two example graphs that can be read in in gpickle format here with a snippet that reads them in and times them:   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g0f17rgplr4gfix/AACzmXG_wXbKGXgQhEpdV2uza?dl=0  Calling is_isomorphic in networkx 1.9.1 in the anaconda distribution (or any python 2.7.x distribution) results in a loop that takes anywhere from 5-15 minutes to longer to exit compared to a typical sub-second performance for comparable graph comparisons.
