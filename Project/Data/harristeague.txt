minimum_cut returns correct value (flow) but wrong partition for some graphs#TITLE_END#I have found a case where calls to minimum_cut() returns the correct "value" but incorrect "partition".  I traced the source of this problem to the following line:  In: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/flow/maxflow.html#minimum_cut  Line: cutset = [(u, v, d) for u, v, d in R.edges(data=True) if d["flow"] == d["capacity"]]  I have cases where the residual R is returned with some edges where d["flow"] differs from d["capacity"]] by a very, very small number (1e-14 for example).  They are clearly supposed to be equal.  However, they are not included in the cutset thus the partition comes out very wrong.  I have seen this with both dinitz and preflowpush flow functions.  It seems that a "nearly equal" comparison would solve this issue.  I realize this might be dangerous since it's not clear how to set the threshold for nearly equal.  Perhaps there is a more elegant way.  I'm not a contributor so wouldn't know how to submit a fix (sorry).

cut_size optional argument T not actually supported#TITLE_END#https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/cuts.py  def cut_size(G, S, T=None, weight=None):    ...  Other functions in this module support the optional T by doing below.  I suspect this is intended for this function as well.  if T is None:    T = set(G) - set(S)
