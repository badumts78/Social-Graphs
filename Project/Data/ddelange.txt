Make all.py generator friendly#TITLE_END#Hi 👋   This PR makes `union_all`, `disjoint_union_all`, `compose_all`, `intersection_all` generator friendly, allowing for a much smaller memory footprint when dealing with many graphs.  We have a bunch of large, dense, and overlapping graphs on disk. To create a composition, they would all have to be loaded into memory at the same time. Then, `G.nodes` and `G.edges` are called on all of them without intermediate garbage collect, further increasing memory footprint (this is where we hit a `MemoryError` on a 64GB machine after some iterations in the `compose_all` loops).  This rewrite: - still allows the user to pass a list of graphs - now also allows a generator that loads graphs into memory just-in-time (what we use to avoid `MemoryError`)   - allows garbage collector to deallocate and therefore in-memory overwrite of the `G` variable with each iteration - throws the same errors as before (though some errors are postponed to avoid having to load all graphs into memory at the same point in time) - reduces the function's cognitive and computational complexity (specifically: reduces amount of loops over the graphs to 1)  ~the same can be done for other functions in this module, if you're interested!~ done 😄
