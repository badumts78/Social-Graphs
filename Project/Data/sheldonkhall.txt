no symmetry in graph_edit_distance#TITLE_END#I have been trying to use the network x implementation of the graph edit distance to do some clustering. However this led to some unexpected errors. The root cause of these errors has been a non-symmetric distance matrix that I have tracked back to non-symmetric edit distances produced by the `nx.graph_edit_distance` measure.  A minimal example is this:  g1 is the graph  c - d  with a self edge on d g2 is the graph e - d - c with no self edges  ``` import networkx as nx  n1 = [("c", {"attr": "c"}), ("d", {"attr": "d"})] n2 = [("e", {"attr": "e"}), ("d", {"attr": "d"}), ("c", {"attr": "c"})] e1 = [("c", "d", {"attr": {"c", "d"}}), ("d", "d", {"attr": {"d"}})] e2 = [("c", "d", {"attr": {"c", "d"}}), ("d", "e", {"attr":{"d", "e"}})]  g1 = nx.Graph() g1.add_nodes_from(n1) g1.add_edges_from(e1) g2 = nx.Graph() g2.add_nodes_from(n2) g2.add_edges_from(e2)  match = lambda x, y: x["attr"] == y["attr"] print(nx.graph_edit_distance(g1, g2, node_match=match, edge_match=match) == nx.graph_edit_distance(g2, g1, node_match=match, edge_match=match)) ```  This returns False where I would expect it to be True. I am using the node and edge match methods because I want there to be a substitution cost for nodes and edges.  Can anyone confirm this behaviour is a bug?  In the meantime I will investigate further and check my assumptions.

a hack to force self edges to be ignored on the first node inspected#TITLE_END#An attempt to resolve a dormant bug in the graph edit distance algorithm. The cited paper leaves the implementation of the edge matching up to the user. In the current implementation every time a new node in G1 is matched, self-edges on the newly matched node and every edge from the newly matched node to every other previously matched node in the search tree are inspected for potential edge matches in G2.  The issue arises when the first node matched has a self edge on it. The first node matched implicitly has no previous nodes matched and therefore no edges to any other nodes are inspected. This forces the self-edge to be deleted rather than being matched to an edge between two nodes.  This fix stops edge matching occurring on the first node match. Instead it is allowed only after at least one node match has already occurred.  For full disclosure one of the commented assert statements now fails but all tests pass. I think this is not quite ready to merge, but I was interested to get a second opinion.
