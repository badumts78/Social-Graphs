issue
Multiple paths#TITLE_END#algorithm for finding k edges disjoint paths s.t. sum of weights on those paths is minimum  the described algorithm has 2 implementation:  1. Suurballe: Fast than bhandari, runs dijkstra, limited to graphs with non-negative weights 2. Bhandari: Slower than suurballe, runs bellman-ford, can run on graphs with negative weights (but no negative cycles)  - The algorithm is based on 'Survivable Networks: Algorithms for Diverse Routing' book - The function returns list of lists of nodes representation edge disjoint path - can be modified easily to support (by a simple transformation) minimum sum node-disjoint paths - The algorithms involves reversing edges, so working with Multi was needed - during the project I compared runtimes of suurballe and bhandari on big graphs with random weights, which means besides the tests I wrote, the code works on big graphs  during the run, all the tests I wrote passed, except small issue with 'DID NOT RAISE ..': """ ============================== FAILURES ============================== test_namespace_alias      def test_namespace_alias(): >       with pytest.raises(ImportError): E       Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ImportError'> networkx/tests/test_import.py:5: Failed """ other than that everything is fine, I'd like to hear ur feedback about this issue and how to fix it, and also your feedback in general
