nx.is_isomorphic does not give consisten results#TITLE_END#Hi, could you please take a look at the case about the `nx.is_isomorphic` function? Thank you very much!   ### Current Behavior Two graphs that should be isomorphic are defined as False by `nx.is_ismorphic()` function.  ### Expected Behavior The `nx.is_isomorphic()`function should return True  ### Steps to Reproduce The `G_small.pkl` and `acid_r.pkl` graphs are in the attached `Archive.zip` file.  As far as I know, these two graphs are isomorphic, which is also supported by the first three isomorphic test. However, the last isomorphic test returned False. ```{Python} # load the first graph: G_small G_small = pickle.load(open("G_small.pkl", "rb")) nx.draw(G_small, with_labels=True, font_weight='bold')  # load the second graph: acid_r acid_r = pickle.load(open("acid_r.pkl", "rb")) nx.draw(acid_r, with_labels=True, font_weight="bold")   def node_match(dct1, dct2):     """Helper function for nx.is_isomorphic     This function receives the attribute dictionary for two nodes     Returns True if the attribute are the same     """     atomic_num1 = dct1["atomic_num"]     atomic_num2 = dct2["atomic_num"]     return (atomic_num1 == atomic_num2)       def edge_match(dct1, dct2):     """Helper function for nx.is_isomorphic     This function receives the attribute dictionary for two nodes     Returns True if the attribute are the same     """     bond_type1 = dct1["bond_type"]     bond_type2 = dct2["bond_type"]     return (bond_type1 == bond_type2)   print(nx.is_isomorphic(G_small, acid_r))  #True print(nx.is_isomorphic(G_small, acid_r, node_match=node_match))  #True print(nx.is_isomorphic(G_small, acid_r, edge_match=edge_match))  #True print(nx.is_isomorphic(G_small, acid_r, node_match, edge_match))  #False ``` [Archive.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/8945464/Archive.zip)    ### Environment Python version: 3.9.10  NetworkX version: 2.8   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
