Graph becomes invalid after node removal#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  When removing a node from a networkx graph using G.remove_node(...), the graph becomes somehow invalid as the internal node-indices become unstable.  ### Expected Behavior  After removing a node, the graph should still work fine as before.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` import networkx as nx  G = nx.path_graph(5) nx.set_node_attributes(G, {i: i for i in range(5)}, 'idx') G.remove_node(2) idx3 = [i for i, node in enumerate(G.nodes) if G.nodes[node]["idx"] == 4][0] print(G.nodes[idx3]["idx"]) ``` ### Environment  Conda environment with  Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version: 3.3  ### Additional context  It would be really nice, if networkx would reassign the internal node labels after removing the nodes. Or if there would be a function to call manually after removing plenty of nodes. If that does not run into issues because the graph becomes invalid after the first removal.
