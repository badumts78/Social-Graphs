issue
add_edge() piles edges from same .csv file, randomly and nx.eulerian_circuit gives an exact same result in one process.#TITLE_END#Hello,   I used this module for resolving Chinese Postman Problem. And from .csv file which has every edge information, I made a graph containing the edges.  ![edgelist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36394296/43242569-c8356716-90dc-11e8-987b-dc473ac9561f.PNG) **This is the .csv file**  Here is a problem, Everytime I run a script, I made edges piled line by line, so I thought that I have it like graph edges: [('node8', 'node1'), ('node1', 'node2'), ... } But graph edge contains them, randomly in every single time I run the script. 1. ![graph g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36394296/43242861-525c3bee-90de-11e8-99e0-9e6197180876.PNG) 2. ![graph g2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36394296/43243051-65a4ef9c-90df-11e8-9467-37742559fd5e.PNG)  I can not understand why this happens, but I can handle it.    **BUT more serious problem is,** When I make a new eulerian circuit by  **nx.eulerian_circuit** It generates exact same eulerian circuit whenever I implement this method in one process, ![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36394296/43242961-d7d3691e-90de-11e8-8736-60c00059befb.PNG)   **I want to make different Euleiran Circuit in one process, you know, eulerian circuit has many solutions. In other word, I want to get several possible Eulerian Circuits when I run the script, once.  In one process, It generates exact same Eulerian Circuit even though I use **nx.eulerian_circuit** many times.**  I used **os.execl** which makes a script run again for finding the Eulerian Circuit I want and it works, but it takes super long,(Running the script, again and again takes a lot of memory of a computer...)  How do I solve this problem??
