umh, i just want to render my graph/network from python script to terminal as inline image, how to do that 😅 ?  <!-- anyone has any experience with using mermaid from within python? -->  My trail for reaching here:  * DeprecationWarning: nx.nx_pydot.to_pydot depends on the pydot package, which hasknown issues and is not actively maintained.

In the future, graph visualization functionality **may be removed** from NetworkX or only available as an add-on package.  Proper graph visualization is hard, and we highly recommend that people visualize their graphs **with tools dedicated** to that task. > \- [NX/Reference/Drawing](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html)

> we have ascii representations of graphs #5602  the text based thing is nice, i wanted to experiment with that too. thanks for sharing it.    > Are you saying you want to render the graph in the terminal window?  nope, i was saying that  - to render an image file from graph (i.e. static image, not in a separate window like `matplotlib.plot.show()` which opens an interactive widget - the rest of the part is covered thereafter by <tt>[imgcat]</tt> module which you don't have to worry about 😃   [imgcat]: https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/

oh, i - missed sharing one part of why i dabbled into weeds of this `networkx.drawing.nx_pydot.to_pydot(my_networkx_graph)` method   ---- _Have shared the following at: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/6638 . Please add your input related to this over there. Thanks 😃_  <details>  - 'ts that the `ms-python.vscode-pylance` (python LS for VSCode) is showing errors with networkx.draw related functions   ~~(wait, i am getting the details of it)~~ _see below_  > "draw" is not a known member of module "networkx" Pylance [reportGeneralTypeIssues](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#reportGeneralTypeIssues) (function) draw: Unknown   > "draw_networkx" is not a known member of module "networkx" Pylance [reportGeneralTypeIssues](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#reportGeneralTypeIssues) (function) draw_networkx: Unknown  </details>
