weight default argument inconsistencies on community detection algorithms#TITLE_END#Hey,  I was running multiple community detection algorithms, and since I started with louvain and noticed the weight parameter defaulted to "weight", I didn't bother setting up this parameter on other algorithms, but after a while I noticed they have different default values for this argument. They are:  defaults to weight=None: * greedy_modularity_communities * naive_greedy_modularity_communities * lukes_partitioning * asyn_lpa_communities  defaults to weight="weight": * louvain_communities * louvain_partitions * kernighan_lin_bisection * modularity  Should they all default to None, to "weight" or is this intentional?  I can follow up with a PR if its suitable. Thanks!
