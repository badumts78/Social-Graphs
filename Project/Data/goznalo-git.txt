dominating_set function randomization#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  Hi there!  First attempt to contribute to the project, so please let me know anything I might have missed or should do differently.   Regarding the PR: I have modified the `networkx/algorithms/dominating.py` file, introducing the possibility of a randomization in the procedure of obtaining the dominating set. This allows finding different sets every time the function is called with the parameter set to True. I have modified the function description accordingly. - I ran my own tests obtaining correct sets (checked agains the `is_dominating_set()` function) of randomly generated digraphs. - I also ran the black pre-commit hook, and the pytest tests.  Thanks for your attention! Looking forward to your feedback. Gonzalo
