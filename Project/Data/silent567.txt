Wrong random_lobster implementation?#TITLE_END#Hi, it seems that [networkx.random_lobster's implementation logic](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/4e9771f04192e94a5cbdd71249a983d124a56593/networkx/generators/random_graphs.py#L1009) is not aligned with the common definition as given in [wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LobsterGraph.html) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphs#Lobster). For example, it can not produce the simplest lobster graph examples such as ![lobster_example](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dr_Nasreen_Khan/publication/256292297/figure/fig5/AS:669566174756876@1536648424468/A-diameter-2-lobster-graph.png).

Hi all, thanks for taking care of this. It seems that the generator can generate any lobster now. It's great!   For myself, I just utilized my simple toy codes for generating lobsters and the project has almost finished. In my case, neural networks can very easily overfit the datasets as the original version can only generate very limited  (actually finite right? 3^n at most?) graphs. The degree distribution is also critical in my problem. Anyway, it's great to see this PR and wish networkx a good future~
