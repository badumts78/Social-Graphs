kernighan lin optimization#TITLE_END#I have noticed that the NetworkX implementation of Kernighan-Lin is missing the optimizations suggested by here: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=259855 They are proven to produce exactly the same result, and contribute a massive speedup to KL. In particular, the column scanning method would be very easy to implement. The NetworkX KL implementation is too slow to use for any sizable graph, and the column scanning optimization should increase its usability to graphs of 10x the current size.  I intend to make a pull request adding column scanning to KL. Would this be more appropriate as an additional algorithm, or is it ok as a change to KL?
