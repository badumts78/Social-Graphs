Inconsistent GML Underscore Handling in Reading/Writing with Proposed Solution#TITLE_END#In the official GML documentation (http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/files/lehrstuhl/brandenburg/projekte/gml/gml-technical-report.pdf) there are a list of regular expressions representing valid strings for every field. In the field for keys; the regular expression is:  `::=[a-z A-Z][a-z A-Z0-9]*`  In the tokenization for reading in networkx/readwrite/gml.py there is the following pattern:  (parse_gml_lines) `r'[A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z_]*\b',  # keys`  As you can see this supports key names with underscores in them such as "underscore_string". This by itself would be fine, the issue results in the incongruence with the writing keys which are:  (generate_gml) `valid_keys = re.compile('^[A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z]*$')`  As you can see, the specifications for reading and writing valid GML are different. I believe they should be the same. Personally I am a proponent for allowing underscores even though it is not in the official documentation. Thank you for your time.
