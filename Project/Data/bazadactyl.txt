issue
write_graph6 uses excessive amounts of memory#TITLE_END#I am working with a graph of roughly 650,000 edges, with each vertex being a short string of <100 characters. I found that calling the write_graph6() function to write my graph to disk uses too much memory and takes significantly longer than the most other formats (I've tried adjlist, gexf, gml, pickle, YAML, and more).  In my tests, write_graph6() uses gigabytes of memory and over two minutes to write a 20,000 edge graph to disk, other methods take significantly less memory and mere seconds for my original 650,000 edge graph.  More specifically, for 10,000 edges the function uses ~5GB and with 20,000 edges it uses ~20GB of memory. When I try to use my 650,000 edge graph, my system (with 32GB of memory) runs out of memory and starts thrashing.  I've attached the 20,000 edge graph as an adjlist (delimited by two pipes: ||) and YAML.
