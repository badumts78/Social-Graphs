issue
shortest path fail on connected network#TITLE_END#Hello, I have a network of navigation point (file 20180807_edges2.txt, in the format nodeA nodeB weight.)  [20180807_edges2.txt](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/2270620/20180807_edges2.txt)  If I extract the giant component, the network is connected (except two nodes linked each other). If I try to run the shortest_path_length between each couple, for a huge amount of couple I get an error: there is no path between two nodes. I tried to double the link (having a->b, adding b->a) but the problem persists! Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug? Best
