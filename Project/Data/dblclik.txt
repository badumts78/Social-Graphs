Error Attempting to Iterate Over LineCollection#TITLE_END#This is less a bug with the code base and more a bug in the examples, but as a result a number of pieces of example code do not work any longer.  I have cobbled together code that uses the **Directed Graph** ([https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/auto_examples/drawing/plot_directed.html#](url)) example code to implement color maps, line alphas, and a colorbar.  Apparently matplotlib.collections.LineCollection objects are no longer iterable, and thus the code  ``` for i, arc in enumerate(edges):     arc.set_alpha(edge_alphas[i]) ```  does not work (nor does using something like `for e in edges:` or `for i in range(len(edges)):`  The problem also arises in trying to create a colorbar legend by passing the `edges` object to `mpl.collections.PatchCollection()` as this too raise the error that LineCollection objects are not iterable.  Versions:  Python - 3.6 Networkx - 2.2 Matplotlib - 3.0.2  Here is the full code (assuming you have a graph `G` already):  ``` pos = nx.circular_layout(G)  M = G.number_of_edges() node_sizes = [3 + 10 * i for i in range(len(G))] edge_colors = range(2, M + 2) edge_alphas = [(5 + i) / (M + 4) for i in range(M)]  nodes = nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_color='red') edges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edge_color=edge_colors,edge_cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, width=2)  nx.draw_networkx_labels(G,pos,node_labels,font_size=16)  # set alpha value for each edge for i, arc in enumerate(edges):     arc.set_alpha(edge_alphas[i])  pc = mpl.collections.PatchCollection(edges, cmap=plt.cm.Blues) pc.set_array(edge_colors) plt.colorbar(pc)  plt.axis('off') plt.show() ```
