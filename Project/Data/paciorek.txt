Thanks for the suggestions. Setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to 1, using`dask.delayed` on the graph object, and using a small number of tasks don't resolve the problem.  Here's a reproducible example that illustrates the problem. Even though the function being called does essentially nothing, it takes 10s of seconds for the output of the print statements to be shown and for the tasks to finish. If anyone has suggestions as to how best to log what Dask is doing, please let us know.   ``` import pandas as pd import numpy as np import networkx as nx  import dask import dask.multiprocessing  ## graphSeason.xml is available from: ## https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~paciorek/transfer/graphSeason.xml ## G = nx.read_gexf('graphSeason.xml')  import urllib.request import io  url = 'https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~paciorek/transfer/graphSeason.xml' req = urllib.request.Request(url) with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as resp:     G = nx.read_gexf(io.BytesIO(resp.read()))   ## Dummy function that uses G but without any real computation def analyze(departureNode, GG):     print(departureNode, flush = True)     return(GG.name)  dask.config.set(scheduler = 'processes', num_workers = 4)  G = dask.delayed(G)  ## Set up a small number of tasks futures = [] for departureNode in range(12):         futures.append(dask.delayed(analyze)(departureNode, G))  ## This takes a long time for the print statement output to be shown. results = dask.compute(futures) ```
