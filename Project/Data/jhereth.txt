release 2.4 breaks API for nx.Graph#TITLE_END#Up to version 2.3 the following was possible  ``` import networkx as nx graph = nx.Graph() print(graph.node()) ``` In version 2.4 this results in  ``` >>> graph.node Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute 'node' ```  The reason seems to be that the `node = nodes` aliasing [has been removed](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/6b1ce03f485076d39994e8d624bbf6ca82466eb9#diff-08b36eaddc63c3d59799ce3e16199748L765) (originally announced for 3.x).
