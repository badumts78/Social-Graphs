VF2 graph isomorphism memory leak problem#TITLE_END#There is a circular reference between DigraphMatcher and Distate. This leads to a memory leak.  Since Python garbage collector does not deallocate memory of a circular references. So I suggest either using weakref.ref() to make a loose interdependence or to rethink the State class (eventually implement it's functionality internally in the DiGraphMatcher). Another source of memory leak might be the .copy() operations in initialize() and match() methods.   This becomes a serious problem when there are many(x10.000) instances of DiGraphMatcher which  leads to "out of memory" exception and program crash.
