issue
`shortest_path_length()` specifies return value of `int` but was `float`#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  if `shortest_path_length` is used with weights containing `float`, a `float` is returned, contrary to the function docs.  ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.DiGraph()  G.add_node(0) G.add_node(1) G.add_node(2)  G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=3.33333) G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.75555)  length = nx.shortest_path_length(G, source=0, target=2, weight='weight', method='dijkstra') print(length) print(type(length)) ```  ``` 8.08888 <class 'float'> ```  ### Expected Behavior  According to the documentation I would expect an integer or a `ValueError`, as it specifies that an `int` is returned -- see [docs](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/generic.html#shortest_path_length) and [code](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/729bec23b10e89b5f6d37175e30484f2278107c4/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/generic.py#L225-L229)  however, the underlying function used here, `dijkstra_path_length`, [specifies](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/729bec23b10e89b5f6d37175e30484f2278107c4/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py#L205-L208) that a "number" is returned.  Perhaps this is a documentation bug? Are float in edge weights supported (with the caveat of floating point issues)?  ### Steps to Reproduce  see above  ### Environment  Python version: Python 3.12.3 NetworkX version: 3.3
