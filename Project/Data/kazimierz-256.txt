Contribution proposal: New graph similarity measures#TITLE_END#Encouraged by the request for improving the available choices (on the [similarity measures](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/similarity.html) page) I would like to consult the NetworkX community before contributing.  Which of the following contributions would be accepted as a pull-request:  1. Polynomial approximation of Graph Edit Distance proposed by Kaspar Riesen and Horst Bunke in 2009 _[Approximate graph edit distance computation by means of bipartite graph matching](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026288560800084X)_. 2. A generalized version of the above (in the case of directed graphs) which I have personally invented and formally derived. The derivation is not publicly available, but, if required, I am willing to share it.  Are there any special requirements for the above contribution ideas (e.g. publicly sharing my derivation via github perhaps)?

Add negative cycle detection heuristic#TITLE_END#This is a custom-invented heuristic for negative-weight cycle detection. * In the case of graphs with negative cycles, it increases the performance tenfold, oftentimes up to 20 and sometimes even 30X. * In the case of graphs without negative cycles, the performance decreases only by a few percent with a reasonable variance. Additionally, in theory, the cost of the heuristic is negligible, which agrees with observed behaviour. * Performance was tested on random graphs with 20-200 vertices with varying number of densities 10%, 50%, 90% with edge costs spanning the range [-1, max] where max was on the order of 20 to 90. * Correctness was tested on a larger set of graphs than the one provided in the test suite. * I invented this gem 3 years ago. Instead of letting it rot away in a private repository I decided to make it openly available. * If there are any doubs about the theoretical correctness of the heuristic, I would be glad to explain. * Highly critical feedback from the NetworkX community is most welcome!

Hi there! You could use the [optimal edit paths](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.similarity.optimal_edit_paths.html#networkx.algorithms.similarity.optimal_edit_paths) method to determine which nodes from the pattern graph get transformed into the data graph. Any such node mapping determines the approximate matching you are looking for.
