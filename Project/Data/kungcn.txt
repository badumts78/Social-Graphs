issue
the one which installed by pip can't run but that installed by building this repo is ok#TITLE_END#I am learning how to read gml by networkx, so I write such code.  ``` import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  if __name__ == '__main__':     graph = "./karate.gml" # Karate Club dataset     Graph = nx.read_gml(graph, label='id')     nx.draw(Graph)     plt.show() ```  Terminal shows such error:   However, my classmate installed networkx by downloading code to build and code works normally. After I installed it by his way, it succeeded.  I think there is sth. wrong in pip release or it isn't the latest one. It will be better if you can update the release in pip. ![2017-07-01 00-57-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12772780/27746359-7ca48b36-5df9-11e7-92f9-0fe532a9c186.png)
