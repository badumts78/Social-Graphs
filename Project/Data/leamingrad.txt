Preserve edge attributes when using branching algorithms#TITLE_END#This pull request contains a patch to allow the `Edmonds` class to preserve the edge attributes of the source graph when working out an optimum.  The function is disabled by default, so all of the branching algorithms gain a new `preserve_attrs` keyword argument to enable it. Tests are added for both preserving and discarding attributes.  Feedback is welcome - I am happy to make changes. I am not sure exactly how this change will interract with the change in #2117 - looking at the diff there, this change is orthogonal, but I would guess it might cause merge conflicts.
