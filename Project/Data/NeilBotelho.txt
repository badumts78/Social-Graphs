Handle edge cases for greedy_modularity_communities#TITLE_END#Hi, This fork addresses issue https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5562 using the solution proposed by [dschult](https://github.com/dschult) in the issue discussion. But like [j-hap](https://github.com/j-hap) mentions the error still gets thrown by any downstream functions like `networkx.algorithms.community.quality.modularity` that the result gets passed to.  If there are any changes that need to be made, I'd be happy to add those to my PR  Closes #5562
