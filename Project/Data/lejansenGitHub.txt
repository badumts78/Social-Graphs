FilterAdjacency: __len__ is recalculated unnecessarily #7377#TITLE_END#__len__ result is being stored for FilterAdjacency and FilterAtlas  Fixes #7377   Impacts of dynamic computation of len --- The class FilterAdjacency is only used in views and therefore only works on frozen sets of edges and nodes. Despite that its __len__ function is recalculated each time it is called instead of it being calculated and stored once upon its first call.  ### Current Behavior  __len__ of FilterAdjacency is recalculated unnecessarily upon each call using up 80% of runtime for my application.  ### Expected Behavior  __len__ of FilterAdjacency should calculated and stored once upon its first call. For all other calls the stored value is returned.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Any use of nx.subgraph_view shows this behaviour. Very poor performance shows in my case for number of nodes > 100.000.  ### Environment  Should be completely independent of env.  Python version: 3.11.8  NetworkX version: 3.2.1
