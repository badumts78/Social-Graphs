Reversed arrow on the calculation for a directed graph edit distance#TITLE_END#I just wondering why in the follows situation the calculated edit distance is two and not one.  ``` import networkx as nx  g1 = nx.DiGraph() g1.add_edge("a","b") g1.add_edge("b","c") g1.add_edge("c","a")  g2 = nx.DiGraph() g2.add_edge("a","b") g2.add_edge("b","c") g2.add_edge("a","c")  edit_distance = nx.graph_edit_distance(g1, g2) print(edit_distance) ```  I understand that we need to remove an arrow and insert a new one, so it makes an edit distance of two. But why besides addition and deletion, it has not been implemented the reverse cost? Current situation: addition = 1 deletion = 1 reverse = deletion + addition  Desired situation: addition = 1 deletion = 1 reverse = 1
