Arrows as a plot example.#TITLE_END#This Pull request gives an example of usage of the newly added arrows heads for directed edges or arcs.  Is a simple plot where node sizes differ from node to node, and `arrowstyle` and `arrowsize` are different from default. It should output something like:  ![arrows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10630980/34104380-788c3706-e3f0-11e7-846e-2ab68ebfc9a0.png)

Digraph Arrows to fix #2757#TITLE_END#This pull request targets to replace the thicker lines used to draw arcs (directed edges) used in the nx_pylab.py file with arrow heads.  The main idea is to replace the `matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` with a list of `matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch`.  The implementation is a bit slower than the original, but adds some clarity when zooming on a a network, e.g. consider the following the network with N nodes and N*2 edges:  ``` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import networkx as nx   G = nx.Digraph() G = nx.generators.directed.random_uniform_k_out_graph(N, 2) pos = nx.layout.spring_layout(G) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=pos, edge_color='g', arrowstyle='-|>') plt.show() ```  For **N=100**, this normally draws: ![regular_100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10630980/32992068-877bffb4-cd46-11e7-81e9-ce2aebd6834f.png)  With this pull request: ![arrows_100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10630980/32992075-9ef38e64-cd46-11e7-988a-9c9b8fcc5f5d.png)  For **N=1000**  Zooming on the network gives: ![regular_1000_zoom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10630980/32992091-bdc23278-cd46-11e7-8cf4-a0242f6175de.png)  With this pull request: ![arrows_1000_zoom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10630980/32992101-cf66eb7c-cd46-11e7-9ffd-bac6115e056c.png)  I added the keyword `arrowstyle` to be able to use all the styles for `matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch`, however, the drawing is chaotic for some of them.

Improvement to arrowheads of a DiGraph edges.#TITLE_END#I was wondering if there was  planing on changing the arrowheads of the edges of directed graphs to be more arrow like (triangular shape instead of thicker line). For instance see [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47213650/changing-arrowhead-type-in-networkx) on stackoverflow.
