Fix typos in the networkx codebase#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> I could see some issues related to fixing typos, hence I ran the `codespell` library over the `networkx` codebase and could fix various typos. I have personally checked each typo to avoid any false positives.

Fix typo in Katz.py#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  The formula mentioned in this comment (`y^T = Alpha * x^T A - Beta`) is incorrect as the formula in the code has a `+` sign instead!

I would like to solve this issue, These are the uncovered scenarios in the` Codecov` report which repeat themselves multiple times (4 in count). <img width="773" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90216905/211018279-26f30741-d485-47ac-9675-6b06d098af06.png">  I am not syntactically aware of `networkx`, but I believe the first one would be raised when some `kwargs` are given as arguments with `flow_func = None` - ``` # Raised the coverage from 68% to 70% locally         G = self.G         pytest.raises(             nx.NetworkXError,             nx.minimum_cut,             G,             "x",             "y",             flow_func=None,             global_relabel_freq = 1.5,             value_only = False         ) ``` I not sure what `callable(flow_func)` checks and couldn't find anything relevant in the documentation either.  P.S. I am new to `networkx` repo so I would like some guidance here. Thanks !

> Just to add: this issue has been open for a while and multiple contributors have taken a crack at it, so it's very likely it is already resolved.  Yes I had run `pytest --cov=networkx networkx` which gives this result for `maxflow.py` - ``` ---------- coverage: platform win32, python 3.11.0-final-0 ----------- Name                                                                Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ``` `networkx\algorithms\flow\maxflow.py                                    56     14     32      6    70%`  Which suggests that the issue still exists, right?

As someone who just setup `networkx` locally, `PYTHONPATH=. pytest networkx` did not work for me too. I used the miniforge prompt and had to run `pytest networkx` .So this command would be used for a bunch for command line terminals like Anaconda prompt, Miniforge prompt, Command prompt. +1 for `pytest --pyargs networkx` for consistency across all platforms !
