read_pajek issues with *edges and *arcs headers#TITLE_END#Since the Pajek format does treat in the same way the header _*arcs_ or _*edges_ to define the number of links in the network, the behaviour on `nx.read_pajek()` should be more clear about the real behaviour like the source code explains:  ``` if l.lower().startswith("*edge"):                 # switch from multidigraph to multigraph                 G = nx.MultiGraph(G)             if l.lower().startswith("*arcs"):                 # switch to directed with multiple arcs for each existing edge                 G = G.to_directed() ``` I would expect an optional parameter such as `create_using` as other import functions and let the file I am reading with either _*edge_ or _*arc_ header to avoid confusion.
