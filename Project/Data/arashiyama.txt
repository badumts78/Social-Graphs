GraphML crashes with unknown keytype.#TITLE_END#When trying to parse a GraphML file I am getting the following error  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "filesmurp.py", line 51, in <module>     tree = nx.read_graphml(temp_path)   File "<string>", line 2, in read_graphml   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 263, in _open_file     result = func(_new_args, *_kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 153, in read_graphml     glist=list(reader(path))   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 355, in __call__     (keys,defaults) = self.find_graphml_keys(self.xml)   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 497, in find_graphml_keys     raise nx.NetworkXError("Unknown key type in file.")  It appears to choke on the following GraphML line: <key attr.name="MaltegoEntity" for="node" id="d4"/>  attr_files is set to "yfiles" by the routine as k.get('attr.type') is set to none.  Any advice gratefully received.
