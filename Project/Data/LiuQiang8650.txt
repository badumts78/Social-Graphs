How to get the list of all nodes#TITLE_END#Recently,I have used a useful software named SCI2(Science of Science) created by Indiana University.From some python scripts of this software.I find command like `numbywork = g.nodes[:]`It attempts to make a copy of the list of all nodes in graph g.But when I tried something like that by `a = g.nodes[:]` It tell me "TypeError:unhashable type:'slice'".   What I used is python3 and networkx 2.1.So I want to find someone knows about the python2 and earlier version of networkx to tell me how can command like `numbywork = g.nodes[:]` be run correctly.    Somebody has told me that in earlier version of networkx g.nodes() can get the list of all nodes.But why can the command without brackets also work?
