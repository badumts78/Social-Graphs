Unexpected behaviour of .edges#TITLE_END#When using a string to look up edges the string gets interpreted as an array which results in the edges call returning edges with the id of any of the chars of the string. If the string is surrounded by a list it works as expected. This behavior was a little surprising to me, but if it is expected feel free to ignore this.  ### Current Behavior ``` python import networkx as nx g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edge("b", "c") g.edges("ab") OutEdgeDataView([('b', 'c')]) g.edges(["ab"]) OutEdgeDataView([]) ```  ### Expected Behavior  ``` python import networkx as nx g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edge("b", "c") g.edges("ab") OutEdgeDataView([]) ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.9.13 NetworkX version: '3.0.0'
