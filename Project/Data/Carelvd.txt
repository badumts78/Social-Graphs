issue
The use of Super#TITLE_END#Hi,  I was trying to merge a Network X Graph class, specifically the MultiDiGraph class, with another class of my own and found it did not make any calls via super() method but rather hardcoded the inheritance references. Is there some underlying design choice or reason that this is/isn't done ?  My understanding is that one may enable quite a lot of inter class mixing/inheritance by using super over the explicit calling/indentification of the parent class. There are, however, also valid circumstances where this is not prefered. For the most part I've found delegating super calls to work well, except when messing with meta classes. I think there was an article called "super considered super" that explained this and some of the David Beazely Metaclass vids show how to leverage this in powerful/obscure ways.   One reason for not doing this is to accomodate older Python versions, as I understand it.  The one example I recall that shows how the MRO for the mixture class will correctly assign the arguments in order according to it's ancestors, that is in the order in which they appear as parents.  ``` class A:  def __init__(A_arg, *args, *kvps):   super().__init__(*args, **kvps)  class B :   def __init__(B_arg, *args, *kvps):   super().__init__(*args, **kvps)  class C:  def __init__(C_arg, *args, *kvps):   super().__init__(*args, **kvps)  class mixture(C,B,A):  def __init__(*args, *kvps):   super().__init__(*args, **kvps) ```  I will test this out in due course and issue a pull request I just wanted to check I'm not going against the grain before I do so.
