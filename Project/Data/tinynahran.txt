issue
Incomplete result concerning degree_mixing_matrix and degree_mixing_dict#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> I have a sparse, undirected and weighted network of 4200 nodes (projected from a bipartite graph). About 200 of the nodes are isolated. When I do degree_mixing_matrix, passing None for nodes or all nodes for nodes kwarg, I get a matrix of 370 by 370.  I thought, maybe, only the giant component (about 3900 in size) is calculated? But when G=giant component, the returned matrix is still the same size. Then I tried assortativity related functions. They return the same matrix.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> Should return a matrix of assortativity/degree correlation of 4200.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: NetworkX version: 2.5  ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
