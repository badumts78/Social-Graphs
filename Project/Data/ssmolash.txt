Misquoted max iteration during exception handling for hits#TITLE_END#When `max_iter` is set to 1 and hits fails to converge, exception message states that hits failed to converge after 3 iterations. Should the following line be `i-1` instead? I'd be happy to write a pull request for this.  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/d7d906e1d16ef331da0bc1d149953e7532155acc/networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/hits_alg.py#L111

Fix PageRank personalize docstring#TITLE_END#Fix docstring for PageRank personalization vector - personalization vector must have at least one non-zero value (ie. personalization values for each node can be zero provided that at least one personalization value for one node is non-zero).  Add test for zero personalization vector.  Add test for at least one non-zero personalization value.  Fix `test_personalization` - set `alpha` to 0.85. If `alpha` is 0, personalization vector does not contribute to PageRank. 
issue
Tweak iteration logic of HITS#TITLE_END#Refactor HITS convergence iteration logic so that exception message correctly states the number of iterations - iterate while the number of iterations is less than or equal to `max_iter`. If convergence is achieved within `max_iter` iterations, break out of the loop. If convergence is not achieved within `max_iter` iterations, raise a networkx error.  Create test `test_hits_not_convergent` to test for non-convergence of HITS by setting `max_iter` to 0 - test passes when error is raised and test fails when error is not raised.  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2140  cc: @dschult
