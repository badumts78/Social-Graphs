issue
isomorphism very slow on small graphs (with subgraphs)#TITLE_END#For a tool to draw molecule structures, I want to compare the correct structure for a molecule with the one submitted by a user. For most cases, this works fine, but for some cases, the GraphMatcher.is_isomorphic() function is extremely slow, even for relatively small graphs. The following example consists of 50 nodes, and has 3 subgraphs (for both the source and target graph).  ``` source_graph_nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50] source_graph_edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 10), (2, 11), (3, 12), (3, 13), (4, 14), (4, 15), (4, 16), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (20, 23), (17, 24), (20, 25), (21, 26), (22, 27), (21, 28), (22, 29), (22, 30), (23, 31), (23, 32), (23, 33), (34, 35), (35, 36), (35, 37), (35, 38), (34, 39), (37, 40), (37, 41), (37, 42), (34, 43), (34, 44), (38, 45), (38, 46), (38, 47), (36, 48), (36, 49), (36, 50)]  target_graph_nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50] target_graph_edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7), (1, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 12), (2, 13), (3, 14), (4, 15), (4, 16), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (17, 21), (18, 22), (19, 23), (20, 24), (20, 25), (19, 26), (20, 27), (17, 28), (17, 29), (18, 30), (30, 31), (30, 32), (30, 33), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (34, 38), (35, 39), (36, 40), (37, 41), (37, 42), (37, 43), (35, 44), (34, 45), (34, 46), (36, 47), (47, 48), (47, 49), (47, 50)]  source_graph = nx.Graph() source_graph.add_nodes_from(source_graph_nodes) source_graph.add_edges_from(source_graph_edges)  target_graph = nx.Graph() target_graph.add_nodes_from(source_graph_nodes) target_graph.add_edges_from(source_graph_edges) ```  Then when I call:   ``` result = isomorphism.GraphMatcher(target_graph, source_graph) is_isomorphic = result.is_isomorphic() ```  This takes several hours to run. I tried using `result.subgraph_is_isomorphic()` but this also takes very long. I suspect the is_isomorphism function ends up in an infinite loop or something.  TraceBack gives me the following recursive call over and over:  ``` ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/isomorphvf2.py in match(self)     315                         # Recursive call, adding the feasible state.     316                         newstate = self.state.__class__(self, G1_node, G2_node) --> 317                         for mapping in self.match():     318                             yield mapping     319  ```  (yeah I know how recursive works, so I get that the traceback makes sense, but I think in this case the multiple subgraphs make the function either very very slow or infinite looping).
