Fix average_neighbor_degree calculations for directed graph#TITLE_END#Fixes: #5383  There was a problem with average neighbor degree calculations in a directed graph. The method was working as expected when the source argument was "out". But when the source argument was "in", it gave different results then expected.   I have made it so that we check the source argument before deciding on which nodes are neighbors.  Let's say we have the following directed graph: 1->2->3->4 and we are asked to find the average neighbor degree for node 2. Then if the source argument is "in", we should look for the nodes which have an edge "to" node 2 and these will be neighbors of node 2. However, if the source parameter is "out", we should look for the nodes which have an edge "from" node 2 and these will be neighbors of node 2.  I have also updated the documentation of method. I ran tests and some of the results were different from the original test results as expected. I used pen and paper, and checked the work I have done. After getting expected results, I updated test_neighbor_degree file and changed assert statements.

Update extrema bounding method for compute="eccentricities" parameter#TITLE_END#Issue number: [#5402](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5402)  I have updated extrema_bounding function's documentation:     - In parameters section, "eccentricities" is listed with explanation,     - In returns section, eccentricities' return value is listed     - In raises section, NetworkXError to be raised when compute parameter is passed an invalid argument is written      In extrema_bounding function, when compute parameter is passed  "eccentricities" argument, the ruled_out variable is set to an empyt set (rather than an empty dict). Moreover, if the compute parameter is not passed a valid extreme distance metric argument (not one of the 'diameter', 'radius', 'periphery', 'center', 'eccentricities'), a NetworkXError is raised with appropriate message.

I have been debugging the sample code and I have came to conclusion that the issue is not related to NetworkX but Pydot.   After nx.nx_pydot.write_dot(G, 'test.dot') line runs, we see that the label attribute is as expected (please see the image below). ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62771956/162547262-05a6198c-f3f2-48ba-bd3e-a43ef992c51c.png)  This expected data is passed to read_dot function (please see the image below). ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62771956/162547432-9bac75e6-429d-45e6-9562-6927c7dd3337.png)  However, after line 75 in nx.nx_pydot.py runs: ````python P_list = pydot.graph_from_dot_data(data) ```` the attributes dictionary gets updated and it becomes: ````python {'label': '"foo("', 'bar': None, '")"': None} ```` ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62771956/162547721-3893c538-0e2a-4b74-b7c8-f5e7f9853174.png)
