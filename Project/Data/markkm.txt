Added all_pairs_dijkstra, solving #2465#TITLE_END#* Finds shortest weighted paths and lengths between all nodes. * Returns an iterator of dictionaries, keyed by source nodes. * Each dictionary essentially contains the value of   single_source_dijkstra computed at the source node.   The tuple that single_source_dijkstra returns is unpacked   and saved as values to two keys: 'distance' and 'path'.
