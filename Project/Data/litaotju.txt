issue
Functions in draw.nx_pylab can not draw self-loop edges#TITLE_END#Using the code bellow:  import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pylab as plt g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edge(1.1) nx.draw_networkx(g) plt.show()  There is only one node in the graph, and no edges are displayed. I don't kniw this is a defeat or in some other purpose to keep self-loop edge away from drawing in the figure.  Because in some sceniros , to display self-loop edges do make sense. Here I propose to add the self-loop edges  drawing feature in nx_pylab module , and I will work on it if this is indeed necessory.   
issue
The minimum_edge_cut() function  returns empty set([]) in some case#TITLE_END#I've noticed that sometimes the function minimum_edge_cut( digraphA) return a empty set([]) in my examples.For example:  import networkx as nx    a = nx.DiGraph()   a.add_edges_from([(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(3,2),(4,2)])   print nx.minimum_edge_cut(a) ### The following would be printed   set([])    So would be glad to know if you guys know is this correct ? For a weakly connected DiGraph more than 2 nodes, an edge cut should always exist. So may be the minimum_edge_cut should never return an empty set(). 
issue
networkx.write_dot() function often produces memory error.#TITLE_END#I have a networkx graph with about 25000 nodes and 75000 edges, and use the write_dot() function to save the graph to a xxx.dot file,  the memory usage increased from about **300M to 1.9G**, and will produce a **"Memory Error"** exception with no other prompt. So I think maybe this is a weak point of write_dot function, anyone can **improve the memory performance** of this function?  
issue
graph module self.size() function has an bug.#TITLE_END#`networkx.classes.graph` has a problem:  ``` def size(): ....     s = sum(self.degree(weight=weight).values()) / 2 .... ```  but `self.degree()` returns an `int` or a `dict`, so when it returns an `int`, the `int` object has no attribute `values()`.

I've noticed that sometimes the function **minimum_edge_cut( digraphA)** return a empty **set([])** in my examples. So would be glad to know if you guys know is this correct ?
