Algorithm to get IN and OUT component of a directed graph#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  I have added functions to extract the IN and OUT components of a directed graph (that contains a strongly connected component) using a simple random-start BFS. The IN and OUT components are those as described in this [paper by Broder et al][1].   This is my first PR in NetworkX, so I apologize beforehand if my code is badly written. In particular, I was having a lot of thoughts on how to properly refactor the `in_component` and `out_component` as their code content share a lot of similar lines. I look forward to hearing from the community on how to do this correctly as I am here to learn.  Some future work that I am considering are: 1. Add more tests. 2. Algorithm to compute TENDRILS and TUBE (refer to Broder et al.). 3. Uniting these components under a single Bow-tie diagram (defined by these IN, OUT, TENDRILS, TUBE components) function.
