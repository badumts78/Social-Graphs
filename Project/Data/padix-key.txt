issue
Typo in 'kamada_kawai_layout()'#TITLE_END#There is a typo in the docstring  of `kamada_kawai_layout()`. It states that `dist` expects a `float`, but in the text it expects a `dict`: ``` dist : float (default=None)         A two-level dictionary of optimal distances between nodes,         indexed by source and destination node.         If None, the distance is computed using shortest_path_length(). ```

'root' parameter not working in 'graphviz_layout()'#TITLE_END#I would like to plot a graph as a tree and I would like to determine which node to use as root. However, the following is not working: ```python import networkx as nx from networkx.drawing.nx_pydot import graphviz_layout graph = nx.Graph() graph.add_edge("B", "A") nx.draw(     graph,     graphviz_layout(graph, prog="dot", root="A"),     with_labels=True ) plt.show() ``` Output: ![graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28051833/80982036-06614f80-8e2b-11ea-982a-d733f78c2d60.png)  I would like to have `"A"` as root, but instead `"B"` is chosen.
