issue
`draw_networkx` behaves differently when `node_size` is provided#TITLE_END#If I call `draw_networkx` with something like  ``` nx.draw_networkx(g, edgelist=[(0, 1, 0)]) ``` that is, with the egelist a list of tuples of length 3, all works well. However, if I in addition pass a `node_size` argument that is an iterable, the behaviour changes and it expects edgelist to consist of tuples of length 2: ``` nx.draw_networkx(g, edgelist=[(0, 1, 0)], node_size=[10, 20]) ``` ``` /home/ruben/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py in draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist, width, edge_color, style, alpha, arrowstyle, arrowsize, edge_cmap, edge_vmin, edge_vmax, ax, arrows, label, node_size, nodelist, node_shape, **kwds)     659             shrink_target = 0  # space from  head to target     660             if cb.iterable(node_size):  # many node sizes --> 661                 src_node, dst_node = edgelist[i]     662                 index_node = nodelist.index(dst_node)     663                 marker_size = node_size[index_node]  ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2) ``` It may have got something to do with an assumption on graph type, my graph was of type `MultiDiGraph`.  This is not a big issue and easily worked around, but I thought I'd point out the inconsistent behaviour, if indeed it is.
