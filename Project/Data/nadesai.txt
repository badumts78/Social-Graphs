Fix typos in generating NXError in networkx.linalg.graphmatrix.incidence_matrix#TITLE_END#Fixes https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2394.
issue
Error message generation is broken for linalg.graphmatrix.incidence_matrix#TITLE_END#Found this while I was working on something else.  To duplicate, try the following: ``` >>> G = nx.Graph() >>> G.add_nodes_from([0,1,2]) >>> G.add_edges_from([(0,1),(1,2)]) >>> nx.linalg.incidence_matrix(G,edgelist=[(3,2)]) NameError: global name 'NetworkXError' is not defined ``` The error should be ``` NetworkXError: node 3 or 2 in edgelist but not in nodelist ```

Some googling found http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/10983/optimal-algorithm-for-finding-the-girth-of-a-sparse-graph - Virgina Vassilevska Williams' answer yielded the results below.  For a general graph there seems to be a naive O(VE) algorithm (presented [here](http://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/234247/Winter2003-2004/ho/WCFiles/Girth.pdf)) based on running BFS from all points. [Itai and Rodeh](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~itai/publications/Algorithms/min-circuit.pdf) present a O(V^2) algorithm that yields the girth g if g is even, and g+1 if g is odd, and additionally a O(V^2) reduction of the problem to finding a triangle in the graph. If the graph is planar, there appears to exist a O(V) algorithm presented by [Chang and Lu](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4892).

Don't know if this has been fixed yet (after installing the latest master per @SanketDG, the issue still manifests). The offending GML file looks like this:  ``` graph   [   directed 0   node   [     id 0     label "Beak"   ] ...   edge   [     source 8     target 3   ] ... ```  networkx parses the file properly if I remove the newlines after every instance of `graph`, `node`, and `edge`, so that it looks like this:  ``` graph [   directed 0   node [     id 0     label "Beak"   ] ...   edge [     source 8     target 3   ] ... ```
