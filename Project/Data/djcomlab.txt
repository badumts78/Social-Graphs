issue
dag_longest_path(G) doesn't work with graphs of unorderable types#TITLE_END#Hiya,  I'm building my graphs with my own types as nodes e.g. in a DiGraph  ``` p1 = Process() p2 = Process() p3 = Process() G.add_edge(p1, p2) G.add_edge(p1, p3) G.add_edge(p2, p3) ```  however if I run the longest_path function on it, it pops up with  ``` line 425, in dag_longest_path     node, (length, _) = max(dist.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]) TypeError: unorderable types: Process() > Process() ```  I would have guessed the algorithm should be working out the path lengths rather than trying to determine an order on my nodes (I don't really know graph algos, so I could be terrible wrong here).  Any ideas how to workaround this?
