Hi, everyone,   I also suffered this problem these days. At first, I thought it was caused by the IDE (PyCharm). But I just found it takes much less time when I didn't import `networkx`.  FYI, the codes I tried are listed as follows,   * Test with `networkx` ``` import time start_time = time.time() import os import glob import statistics from tqdm import tqdm import numpy as np import torch import networkx as nx  print("\n Runing time %s seconds" % (time.time() - start_time)) ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26733725/87221716-ba89d400-c3a0-11ea-914b-795a9e944dfc.png)  * Test without `networkx` ``` import time start_time = time.time() import os import glob import statistics from tqdm import tqdm import numpy as np import torch # import networkx as nx  <-- comment this  print("\n Runing time %s seconds" % (time.time() - start_time)) ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26733725/87221784-50bdfa00-c3a1-11ea-9f3f-c120eef4fd0a.png)  The `pytorch36` is the `conda` environment. `networkx` is a great work which helps me a lot in my research. Hope you guys can help me out if you have any good suggestion. Thanks.
