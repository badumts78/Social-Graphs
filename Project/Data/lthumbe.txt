issue
Ordering of layers in multipartite_layout changed in v2.7. Add a way to control the order?#TITLE_END#I am trying to run a script to plot graphs, but they're coming out wrong. I've tracked down the issue to incorrect positions obtained from the multipartite_layout command, which is either ignoring or misordering the node layer information.  ### Current Behavior The positions output by multipartite_layout don't order the layers correctly.  ### Expected Behavior The positions output by multipartite_layout should order the layers by value.  ### Steps to Reproduce Here is a snippet of what I currently get for the position of nodes in a small graph: import networkx as nx  ``` G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_node('a',layer=2) G.add_node('b',layer=3) G.add_node('c',layer=1) G.add_node('d',layer=2) G.add_node('e',layer=4) nx.multipartite_layout(G,align='horizontal',subset_key='layer')  {'d': array([-0.27777778, -0.66666667]),  'a': array([ 0.27777778, -0.66666667]),  'b': array([ 0.        , -0.11111111]),  'c': array([0.        , 0.44444444]),  'e': array([0., 1.])} ``` What I expect to get out (and can still see if I use an online compiler) is ``` {'d': array([-0.3125, -0.25  ]),  'a': array([ 0.3125, -0.25  ]),  'b': array([0.   , 0.375]),  'c': array([ 0.   , -0.875]),  'e': array([0., 1.])} ```   ### Environment Python version: 3.9.12 NetworkX version: 2.7.1   ### Additional context On an older computer when I had this issue I was able to resolve it by uninstalling and reinstalling Anaconda. This time I'm working from a new computer with a fresh install and uninstalling/reinstalling doesn't work.
