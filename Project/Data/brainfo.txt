What verson of NetworkX added 'louvain_communities'?#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior when I import network.community or networkx.algorithms.community, there's no attribute 'louvain_communities' to be used.  ```{py}/ /mnt/data/hong/customized_python/gene_level/network.py in community(H, weight)     158      159 def community(H, weight): --> 160     lpc = nx.community.louvain_communities(H, weight)     161     community_index = {n: i for i, com in enumerate(lpc) for n in com}     162     return community_index  AttributeError: module 'networkx.algorithms.community' has no attribute 'louvain_communities' ``` Other attributes such as label_propagation_communities works fine (I also tried networkx.algorithms.community, ) ### Expected Behavior In your manual: The functions in this class are not imported into the top-level networkx namespace. You can access these functions by importing the [networkx.algorithms.community](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/community.html#module-networkx.algorithms.community) module, then accessing the functions as attributes of community. from page https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/community.html there's 'louvain_communities'  as an attribute ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9.7 NetworkX version: 2.6.3 should I update to 2.8?   ### Additional context I also tried python-louvain module and it can work.
