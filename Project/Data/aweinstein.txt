Directed laplacian#TITLE_END#I added a function to get the laplacian of a directed graph. It is based on Ben Edwards' code. 
issue
Fix normalized laplacian when the graph contains selfloops.#TITLE_END#When G contains selfloops, the normalized laplacian is defined as NL = D^{-1/2} (D - A) D^{-1/2}, with A the adjencency matrix and D a diagonal matrix with the sum of the rows of A in the diagonal. The current NetworkX implementation use D with the degree of the nodes in the diagonal, which count selfloops twice (this is the right convension in general, but not the correct one for computing the normalized laplacian). 
issue
Fix and consolidate chess_masters.py.#TITLE_END#Currently there are two different versions of chess_masters.py in the examples, and one of this versions (`multigraph/chess_masters.py`) is not working.   This PR fix the `multigraph/chess_masters.py`, and makes `drawing/chess_masters.py` a symbolic link pointing to `multigraph/chess_masters.py`. 
issue
Add .gitignore#TITLE_END#Create .gitignore by copying .hgignore. Also added networkx.egg-info/.

Note that pull request #741 adds a function to compute the directed laplacian. This PR is based on @bjedwards code.

I get the same result as RONNCC, under Python 2.7, networkx 1.8 and matplotlib 1.3 in a Linux machine.
