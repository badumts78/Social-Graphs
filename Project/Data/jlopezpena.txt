Closeness centrality assumes symmetric distance when "distance" parameter is used#TITLE_END#At the beginning of `nx.closeness_centrality` code there is this logic:  ```python     if distance is not None:         # use Dijkstra's algorithm with specified attribute as edge weight         path_length = functools.partial(nx.single_source_dijkstra_path_length,                                         weight=distance)     else:  # handle either directed or undirected         if G.is_directed() and not reverse:             path_length = nx.single_target_shortest_path_length         else:             path_length = nx.single_source_shortest_path_length ```  This means that if `distance` parameter is passed then the direction of the edges is ignored, and the `reverse` parameter has no effect.  Is this a design decision? I have directed networks with non-symmetric distances and am interested in both inbound and outbound centralities. It looks to me this would be a simple change (checking `reverse` and using `nx.single_target_dijkstra_path_length` if needed). Am willing to make a PR if this is deemed an appropriate change.

Any updates on this? I for one would really appreciate having clustering for directed networks!  Concerning the normalization problem, is there any reason you need to use only one of them? Why not allow the user decide whether to apply edge, triangle, or no normalization at all?
