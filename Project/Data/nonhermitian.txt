issue
Reverse Cuthill McKee Ordering Error#TITLE_END#Attached is an example taken from http://ciprian-zavoianu.blogspot.kr/2009/01/project-bandwidth-reduction.html that is linked from the RCM wikipedia page.  The reverse_cuthill_mckee_ordering in Networkx does not return the result posted at that site.  Interestingly, the builtin Matlab "symrcm" function also does not give the correct result because they forgot to reverse their permutation array, thus giving the Cuthill-McKee ordering.   ``` python import scipy.sparse as sp from networkx.utils import reverse_cuthill_mckee_ordering import networkx as nx from pylab import *  A=array([[1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0],         [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1],         [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],[0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1]], dtype=np.int32) G=nx.from_numpy_matrix(A)  #correct permutation perm=array([6,3,7,5,1,2,4,0]) B=A[np.ix_(perm, perm)] #networkx permutation nx_perm = list(reverse_cuthill_mckee_ordering(G)) C=A[np.ix_(nx_perm, nx_perm)] #matlab permutation mat_perm=array([0,4,2,1,7,5,6,3]) D=A[np.ix_(mat_perm, mat_perm)] subplot(2,2,1) spy(sp.csr_matrix(A)) title('ORIGINAL') subplot(2,2,2) spy(sp.csr_matrix(B)) title('CORRECT') subplot(2,2,3) spy(sp.csr_matrix(C)) title('NETWORKX') subplot(2,2,4) spy(sp.csr_matrix(D)) title('MATLAB') show() ```  ![rcm_test](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1249193/2371610/7c18d230-a82b-11e3-9ddc-d18b62577c71.png)
