Anyone interested in mixing times of random walks on graphs?#TITLE_END#Hi guys, I'm writing a masters thesis concerned with the mixing times of Markov chains. My Markov chains often result from simple- or non-backtracking random walks on simple (random) graphs. So I started writing python code that allows to compute mixing times using your networkx package to represent my graphs (I am a newbie to python). With some additional effort, I could write a Python package having methods like  ``` srw_mixing_time(G, node) plot_nbrw_mixing(G, node) ```  Before doing this I'd like to know if anyone here is interested in the mixing times of random walks on graphs? Hope this is the right place to ask the question :)
