issue
find_cycle() doesn't find cycle in cyclic digraph#TITLE_END#```python print("version: {}".format(nx.__version__)) dg = nx.DiGraph() dg.add_edge(1, 0) dg.add_edge(2, 0) dg.add_edge(1, 2) dg.add_edge(2, 1) find_cycle(dg) ```  ``` version: 1.11 Traceback (most recent call last):    File "<ipython-input-127-ea87764febbd>", line 7, in <module>     find_cycle(dg)    File "xxxx\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\networkx\algorithms\cycles.py", line 453, in find_cycle     raise nx.exception.NetworkXNoCycle('No cycle found.') ```  I believe the problem lies in that when `head` is a previously explored node all paths from the current `start_node` are ignored instead of just pruning from `head`  ```python elif head in explored:      # Then we've already explored it. No loop is possible.      break ```  Removing this condition fixes the bug as far as I can tell given the graphs I am working with. However, a more efficient solution that does proper pruning would be more efficient especially for larger graphs.
