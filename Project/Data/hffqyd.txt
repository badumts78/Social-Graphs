all_simple_paths() took a lot of time to execute#TITLE_END#Hello, thanks for your awesome networkx.   It took a lot of time while I was using networkx to find all paths in a graph. The code I used was like below:  ```python import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline  graph = nx.Graph()  nodes_list  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] edges_list  = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6)]  for n in nodes_list:      graph.add_node(n) for i, e in enumerate(edges_list):      graph.add_edge(*e)  nx.draw_networkx(graph)  path_iter = nx.all_simple_paths(graph, 4, 5)  pathes = [] for p in path_iter:     pathes.append(p) print (pathes) ```  It took me 0.5 second to find all paths when the graph containing 53 nodes and 103 edges on my computer.  But when the nodes and edges increased to more than 1500 and 2800, respectively, it had been running for more than 20 hours already.   Is there any way to decrease the search time to a tolerable level?   Thank you very much.

How to find all paths to a node within n edges#TITLE_END#I'm wondering how I can use `networkx` to find all paths to a node within n edges. For example:   ```python import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline  graph = nx.DiGraph() nodes_list  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] edges_list  = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6)] edge_length = [1 + 0.1*i for i in range(len(edges_list))] for n in nodes_list:      graph.add_node(n)  for i, e in enumerate(edges_list):      graph.add_edge(*e)  nx.draw_networkx(graph)  ```  ![unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10190817/40180710-094588d4-5a1a-11e8-9472-deea007526de.jpg)  Could I find all paths, as in this example the paths [[1, 3, 6], [1, 4, 6]], to node `6` within `2` edges?  Thank you very much!
