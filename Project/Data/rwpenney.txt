Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm#TITLE_END#This implements a new drawing-layout based on the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. It provides a force-directed layout which attempts to make the 2D distance between nodes resemble the path-distance. The implementation is based around the L-BFGS optimizer within scipy.optimize, and has unit-tests for the computation of the cost-function and its first derivative. It has been tested on various randomized network topologies, on sizes up to about 1000 nodes.  Here are some example layouts for a tree, a Watts-Strogatz random graph, the Karate Club network, and a Barabasi-Albert random graph:  ![tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8206669/28241944-488a2d20-6997-11e7-982e-432c92c43579.png) ![watts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8206669/28241945-488c529e-6997-11e7-8edb-0e8e609f24fb.png) ![karate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8206669/28241943-4886538a-6997-11e7-9caf-96257056c275.png) ![barabasi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8206669/28241942-4882b7a2-6997-11e7-80d8-ae687ae4c075.png)

Improved vectorization of Fruchterman-Reingold layout.#TITLE_END#The current upstream implementation of the (non-sparse) Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm uses an explicit for-loop over spatial dimensions, and some nested transpose operations on 3D arrays. This branch replaces the for-loop with direct NumPy indexing operations, and replaces the nested transposes with np.einsum() operations which makes it clearer which axes are being summed when calculating the forces.
