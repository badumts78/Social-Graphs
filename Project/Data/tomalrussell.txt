steiner_tree should accept MultiGraph#TITLE_END#I'm using `steiner_tree` on a road network which may have multiple edges between nodes.   It looks like `steiner_tree` will fail if passed a `MultiGraph`: - as a next-to-last step, edges are generated as `(u, v)` tuples pairwise [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/approximation/steinertree.py#L87) - before being passed to `G.edge_subgraph` which raises a `ValueError` from `nx.filter.show_multiedges`  This should reproduce the issue:  ```python import networkx as nx import networkx.algorithms.approximation as nxa  def test_simple_steiner_tree():     G = nx.Graph()     G.add_weighted_edges_from([         (1, 2, 1),         (2, 3, 1),         (3, 4, 1),         (3, 5, 1)     ])     terminal_nodes = [2, 4, 5]     expected_edges = [         (2, 3),         (3, 4),         (3, 5)     ]     T = nxa.steiner_tree(G, terminal_nodes)     assert list(T.edges) == expected_edges  def test_multi_steiner_tree():     G = nx.MultiGraph()     G.add_weighted_edges_from([         (1, 2, 1),         (2, 3, 1),         (2, 3, 999),         (3, 4, 1),         (3, 5, 1)     ])     terminal_nodes = [2, 4, 5]     expected_edges = [         (2, 3, 0),         (3, 4, 0),  # first edge has weight one         (3, 5, 0)     ]     T = nxa.steiner_tree(G, terminal_nodes)  test_simple_steiner_tree()  # passes test_multi_steiner_tree()  # throws ValueError  ```  The quick fix might be to add `@not_implemented_for('multigraph')`.   For my current purposes, the following does the trick to handle the `MultiGraph` case:  ```python # get unique links pairwise (u, v) links = set(chain.from_iterable(     pairwise(d['path'])     for u, v, d in mst_edges ))  # for each link in the chain multi_edges = [] for u, v in links:         # consider each edge  between the pair of nodes,     # keeping track of the one with the minimum weight     # (there may be a better way - convenience functions/accessors?)     num_edges = G.number_of_edges(u, v)     min_k = 0     min_weight = None     for k in range(num_edges):         curr_weight = G.edges[u, v, k][weight]         if min_weight is None:             min_weight = curr_weight         elif curr_weight < min_weight:             min_weight = curr_weight             min_k = k     multi_edges.append((u, v, min_k))  # create subgraph from multi edges - list of (u, v, k) T = G.edge_subgraph(multi_edges) ```

Trophic Levels #3736#TITLE_END#Work with @chasmani aiming to close #3736   This adds `networkx.algorithms.centrality.trophic` with `trophic_levels` (which does most of the work), `trophic_differences` and `trophic_coherence`.

Trophic levels (feature suggestion)#TITLE_END#Would it be interesting to include an algorithm to calculate trophic levels?  Related notions which could be included are trophic difference and trophic coherence - see wikipedia [1] and [2].   This may be a duplicate of #577 from 2012, which was closed due to inactivity.  I've made an initial attempt over at [3], adding a module at `algorithms.centrality.trophic`.  1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_coherence 2.

issue
Steiner tree not implemented for MultiGraph, see #3155#TITLE_END#This makes the small change suggested in #3155 to error if `steiner_tree` is passed a `MultiGraph`.
