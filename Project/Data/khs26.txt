issue
Apply alphas to individual nodes#TITLE_END#This is my first contribution to a proper codebase, so any guidance would be great.  I've addressed issue #1199 regarding applying alphas to nodes in a similar manner to node colouring.  I haven't added any more tests, but have tested with some of the drawing examples, to make sure that they have the expected behaviour.  I haven't yet modified edges, since there is a lot more colour handling code in the `draw_networkx_edges` function. 
issue
Nodes tested for identity with `==` rather than `is`#TITLE_END#I found a bug in `_bidirectional_pred_succ(G, source, target)`. I had overridden `__cmp__` for the object making up each node (they were meant to represent atoms and the graph represents atomic connectivity). This meant that two nodes could test positive for equality without being identical.  I realise that this is perhaps not a sensible thing on my part, but a quick substitution for `is` does the trick.  ``` def _bidirectional_pred_succ(G, source, target):     """Bidirectional shortest path helper.        Returns (pred,succ,w) where        pred is a dictionary of predecessors from w to the source, and        succ is a dictionary of successors from w to the target.     """     # does BFS from both source and target and meets in the middle     ***if target == source:***         return ({target:None},{source:None},source)      ...      raise nx.NetworkXNoPath("No path between %s and %s." % (source, target)) ```  I will file a PR shortly, but I thought this issue could also arise elsewhere in the code and perhaps needs further investigation. 
comment
What about adding an optional function to be applied to the edges with reduce or something similar? The default be enforced with something like `lambda x, y: y`.
