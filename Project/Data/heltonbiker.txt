issue
add_path adds edges with a single node as endpoints#TITLE_END#When I add a path where one or more consecutive nodes have the same value, an edge is created having that same node as endpoints:  ``` import networkx  graph = networkx.Graph()  graph.add_path([1,2,2,3])  print graph.nodes() print graph.edges()  > [1, 2, 3] > [(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)] > ----------^ edge with same endpoints ```  This behavior has given me a little trouble till I figured it out, and I was a bit surprised that a collapsed edge was even created in this case, since I expected that consecutive nodes with the same value wouldn't be considered an edge. On the other hand, I'm not experienced with graph theory, so perhaps this is what should happen after all.  Anyway, I am not sure this violates some test or not (or even if there is a test for this), so that's why I am opening this issue.
