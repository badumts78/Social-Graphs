Clarify order preservation as a public contract in graph documentation#TITLE_END#Update NetworkX documentation to clearly state that insertion order is now a guaranteed behaviour for Graph, DiGraph, and related classes, aligning with the public messaging provided during the deprecation of OrderedGraph (and others).  ## Motivation The current documentation states:  > NetworkX uses dicts to store the nodes and neighbors in a graph. So the reporting of nodes and edges for the base graph classes may not necessarily be consistent across versions and platforms; however, the reporting for CPython is consistent across platforms and versions after 3.6. - [link](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/index.html#:~:text=however%2C%20the%20reporting%20for%20CPython%20is%20consistent%20across%20platforms%20and%20versions%20after%203.6.)  The current language does not clearly articulate the explicit contract that **NetworkX** now upholds regarding insertion order. While the use of dictionaries underlies this behaviour, it remains an internal implementation detail, not the basis on which users should be expected to rely.  Instead of referencing incidental behaviour, the documentation should affirmatively state that order preservation is a guaranteed feature of the public API for Python ≥ 3.7, as was communicated during the deprecation of OrderedGraph (and others).  The deprecation message in question: > OrderedGraph is deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0. Use Graph instead, which guarantees order is preserved for Python >= 3.7.” - [link](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4629/files#diff-5ea87f9002b4d7585751c9cf466f3497db7e62cef2fbb44921a050a2fb8cdd0fR56-R58)  This was a clear and a public commitment to order preservation, and now that the Ordered* classes have been removed, the documentation should reflect this guarantee more explicitly.
