Add bellman-ford as alternative algorithm in generic shortest path solving method#TITLE_END#As documented [here](https://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html)(**UPDATE**, the url was moved to [here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html#module-networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.generic)), some generic method for solving undirected and directed shortest path problem, including ``shortest_path``, ``all_shortest_paths``, ``shortest_path_length`` and ``average_shortest_path_length``.  Those method are actually using dijkstra algorithm according to the source code. I think it reasonable if we are using those method for problems (e.g., social networks) with non-negative edge weights. However, since the naming of those method are not method-specific, they should be able to deal with situations when there exists negative weighted edges in a graph. Bellman-ford is also able to solve undirected graphs if there exist no negative weighted edges, and for undirected graphs with negative weighted edges, it will raise errors since that graph will be views as a graph having negative loops if converting to a directed graph. Therefore, I think we should integrate bellman-ford method into those methods, at least allow it as an alternative method when users are calling those functions.
