issue
Gallery Example: Drawing custom node icons on network using MPL#TITLE_END#The following code is intended to address issue number #4623  This adds an example of drawing a network and annotating with matplotlib.   For this example, we create a simple server topology with a router, 3 switches and 3 PCs per switch. We then replace each node with an image of the respective device, as shown below:  ![myplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24524053/108859668-bf2c9100-75ed-11eb-83ad-76166cbb6cbd.png)

> This could still be a useful example to add, but I was hoping for some examples of graphs where matplotlib is used to add things to the subplot with the graph drawn by nx.draw. For example, I was imaging something where the default nodes are replaced (e.g., vertical bars, icons, another graph). Or additional information is overlaid on the subplot containing the graph drawn by nx.draw (e.g., some sort of "circling" or "grouping" of nodes/edges). Please see the SO example or some of the figures I shared to see some examples of what I was expecting.  We will have a look at doing this now.   We'll also clean up the code for the above graph and share it so you can see if it is indeed a good unique example to add.

Hi Jarrod, @sharwinbobde  and I have worked on a further example (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4633) using MPL to annotate  I think this may be closer to what you suggested initially. Do you think some explicit annotations (i/e circles and arrows) would be worth adding?  Please let me know what you think, and where it could potentially improve :)
