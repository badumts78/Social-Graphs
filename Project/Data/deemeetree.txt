Incorrect betweenness centrality calculation for directed weighted graphs#TITLE_END#I calculate betweenness centrality of a directed, weighted graph using this measure:   https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness_centrality.html  However, as it turns out, your algorithm gives a higher betweenness centrality score to the nodes that have lower edge weight (even if they are embedded similarly in the graph). Is this normal?   My intuition is that it should be the other way round: the higher is the combination of edge weights for a node, the higher is the chance that the shortest path will go through that node. Don't you think so?
