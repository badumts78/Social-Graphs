issue
Wrong colormap returned in `nx.draw_networkx_edges` #TITLE_END#MWE: ```  import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import networkx as nx import itertools  # Graph size m = 5  # Create a random weights weights = [ ((i, j), 2*np.random.random()-1) for i, j in itertools.product(np.arange(m), np.arange(m))]  # Create graph and set weights G = nx.complete_graph(m) nx.set_edge_attributes(G, dict(weights), 'weight') edgelist, edge_color = zip(*nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight').items())  # Draw graph fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,5)) pos = nx.circular_layout(G) nodes = nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_color='#aaaaaa', axes=ax) edges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=edgelist, edge_color=edge_color, edge_cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, axes=ax) cb = plt.colorbar(edges, ax=ax) plt.axis('off') print(edges.cmap.name) ```  For some reason (bug perhaps), the `cmap`  returned by `nx.draw_networkx_edges` is set to `viridis` instead the one set in function call. Hence after the call to `draw_networkx_edges` I have set:      edges.cmap = plt.cmap.coolwarm     edges.set_clim(np.min(edge_color),np.max(edge_color))  And that works.  For sake of documentation NetworkX version is `2.4`. Stable in October, 2019.
