Makes is_path return False for single node paths#TITLE_END## description  The is_path method currently returns True for single-node paths. In my mind, a single node cannot be said to constitute a path. Consequently, the method should return False. I therefore corrected the aforementioned method and added a test case to verify it works correctly.  # changes introduced  The is_path method now checks the length of the path and returns False if it is shorter than two.  # before PR  import networkx as nx G = nx.MultiDiGraph() G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 4)]) yet_another_invalid_path = [2] # a single node is not a path assert nx.is_path(G, yet_another_invalid_path) # apparently it is  # after PR  import networkx as nx G = nx.MultiDiGraph() G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 4)]) yet_another_invalid_path = [2] # a single node is not a path assert not nx.is_path(G, yet_another_invalid_path) # indeed, a single node is not a path

Improve is_path#TITLE_END### Description  is_path currently raises a KeyError if a node in the path provided does not exist.  The more appropriate outcome would be a False output, since the path provided is not, in fact, a path.  ## Example to trigger the problem  import networkx as nx  G = nx.MultiDiGraph()  assert nx.is_path(G,[0,1]) == False  ## Solution  To address this, I revised the is_path method to check if each element on the tentative path is a nodem namely by calling has_node on each iteration.

all_simple_paths returns repeated paths if there are parallel arcs along the way#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  The method all_simple_paths returns the same path multiple times if there are parallel arcs along the path. I have tested this with MultiDiGraphs.  This behaviour reflects the fact that there are different paths going through the same nodes, and since the method returns paths as sequences of nodes (unlike all_simple_edge_paths), the same path ends up being returned multiple times.  ### Expected Behavior  One would expect this method to return only unique node paths, since not much is gained by repeating the paths.  Users seeking to find the actual paths (i.e., with edge keys) or the number of different paths should simply use all_simple_edge_paths.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` network = nx.MultiDiGraph()  number_nodes = 20  for node_index in range(number_nodes):      network.add_node(node_index)  list_edges = [     (0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7),(7,8),(8,9),(9,10),     (0,11),(11,12),(12,13),(13,5),     (6,14),(14,15),(15,16),(16,17),(17,18),(18,19),     (8,8),     (15,16)      ]  for _edge in list_edges:      network.add_edge(_edge[0],_edge[1])  edge_paths = list(nx.all_simple_edge_paths(network,0, 16))  paths = list(nx.all_simple_paths(network,0, 16))  for path_index in range(len(paths)):     #print('paths.count(paths[path_index]): '+str(paths.count(paths[path_index])))     #print('edge_paths.count(edge_paths[path_index]): '+str(edge_paths.count(edge_paths[path_index])))     assert paths.count(paths[path_index]) == edge_paths.count(edge_paths[path_index]) ```  ### Environment  Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.8.4  ### Additional context  I have only tested this using MultiDiGraphs  ### Suggestion  I don't think this behaviour is a dealbreaker nor completely unexpected. As such, I think explaining this behaviour in the documentation would be enough.
