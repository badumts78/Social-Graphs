Graph - Edges lost orientation after added to object#TITLE_END#Hello,  I’ve create a Graph() object and add in the edge path I would like for it to follow. However with I print the object I notice that the edge orientation is swapped for a few of the entries in the graph. This in return impacts the calculation I perform to find the longest path. How do I preserve the order the edges are added to the graph? This is important for me to recover the correct path.  Example:  Here add to graph 5 4 Here add to graph **3 5** Here add to graph 4 2 Here add to graph 4 1 Here add to graph **6 2** Here add to graph **6 1** Tgraph [('5', '4'), **('5', '3')**, ('4', '2'), ('4', '1'), **('2', '6'**), **('1', '6')**]  Notice that the ones in bold do not maintain edge orientation order  Then I use: T = nx.dfs_tree(graph,1) = to start the traversal with the 1st element named ‘1’ longest_path = nx.dag_longest_path(T) shortest_path = nx.dijkstra_path(graph,longest_path[0],longest_path[-1])  This is what is returned: Longest_path = ['1', '4', '5', '3'] Shortest_path = ['1', '4', '5', '3'] Which is incorrect.  I believe the issue begins with the incorrect edge swap. Can someone assist me in how to maintain the order?  Best, Shatavia
