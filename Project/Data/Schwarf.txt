Fix for issue #7645: Do not preserve 'cw' and 'ccw' attributes in PlanarEmbedding.to_undirected()#TITLE_END#I propose this fix for [issue #7645](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7645). The changes ensure that the 'cw' and 'ccw' attributes are not preserved for both graphs and multi-graphs in the result of PlanarEmbedding.to_undirected().  I have included tests to verify that the issue is resolved.  I would be grateful for any feedback or suggestions to improve this PR. I am more than happy to incorporate any necessary changes based on the review. Thank you for your time and guidance!  Fixes #7645

Fix handling of faux_infinite values in network_simplex#TITLE_END#I've looked into the issue and implemented a potential fix. While I have a general understanding of the high-level idea, I have not studied the network-simplex algorithm in full detail.  From my understanding, the purpose of the `faux_inf value` is to create dummy edges and assign them a "practical infinity" value, rather than using actual infinity. This "practical infinity" is intended to be sufficiently large compared to all other "real" weights and capacities.  Change made:  1. Implemented a new calculation for `faux_inf`:     `faux_inf = (sum(c for c in DEAF.edge_capacities if c < inf) +                 sum(abs(w) for w in DEAF.edge_weights) +                 sum(abs(d) for d in DEAF.node_demands)) * 10 or 1`  2. Added the three sample cases discussed in the issue as tests (for illustration):      - Verified that these tests fail without the fix.      - Confirmed that they pass with the fix applied.  I believe not all three test cases are necessary for permanent inclusion in the codebase. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggest changes.

Hi @dschult I've looked into the issue and believe I have a potential fix. While I understand the high-level idea, I haven't studied the corresponding network-simplex algorithm in full detail.  From my understanding, the idea behind the `faux_inf` value is to create dummy edges and assign them a "practical infinity" value, rather than using actual infinity. This "practical infinity" should be large enough compared to all other "real" weights and capacities.  Here’s my proposed solution: `faux_inf = (sum(c for c in DEAF.edge_capacities if c < inf) +                     sum(abs(w) for w in DEAF.edge_weights) +                     sum(abs(d) for d in DEAF.node_demands))*10`  I tested all three cases listed above by @boothby and they passed.  Could you let me know if I shall open a PR with this solution and corresponding tests?
