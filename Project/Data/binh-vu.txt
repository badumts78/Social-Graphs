issue
Error in maximum_spanning_arborescence algorithm#TITLE_END#I found that the current implementation of the `networkx.algorithms.tree.branchings.maximum_spanning_arborescence` does not return an optimal solution and also not return consistent result.  Networkx version: `2.5`  I tested the algorithm with a graph, that is serialized to two JSON files in [here](https://gist.github.com/binh-vu/8e9775669d6e734a2739b1258263cdb0) and [here](https://gist.github.com/binh-vu/1e3bd1d54fe3d0dd1486b9966bd96fe2). The only different between the two files is the order of nodes/edges.  Code to load the graph:  ```python def load_json(infile: str):     data = json.loads(open(infile).read())     g = nx.MultiDiGraph()     for nid, ndata in data['nodes']:         g.add_node(nid)      for i in range(len(data['edges'])):         data['edges'][i][0] = tuple(data['edges'][i][0])      for (uid, vid, eid), edata in data['edges']:         g.add_edge(uid, vid, eid)      nx.set_node_attributes(g, dict(data['nodes']))     nx.set_edge_attributes(g, dict(data['edges']))     return g ```  Code to run maximum_spanning_arborescence ```python resp = nx.algorithms.tree.branchings.maximum_spanning_arborescence(g, attr='weight',                                                                        preserve_attrs=True) count = sum(edata['data']['weight'] for s, t, e, edata in resp.edges(data=True, keys=True)) print(count) ```  The results are 54 and 63 (weight). They should be equal as the two input graphs are identical and the optimal solution is 67. My initial guess is this is due to choose different roots, but the interface of the algorithm doesn't have anyway for me to run with different roots.
