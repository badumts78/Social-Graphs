Incorrect arborescence definition#TITLE_END#In the `networkx.algorithms.tree.recognition` module, shouldn't an *arborescence* be defined as:  > An arborescence is a directed tree with a single vertex of in-degree equal to 0 (or equivalently with all vertices of in-degree equal to 1 but one).  instead of:  > An arborescence is a directed tree with maximum in-degree equal to 1.  and consequently the `is_arborescence` function be coded as:  ``` return is_tree(G) and [d for n, d in G.in_degree()].count(0) == 1 ```  instead of:  ``` return is_tree(G) and max(d for n, d in G.in_degree()) <= 1 ```  Because it is the definition given in Narsingh Deo's book *Graph Theory with Applications to Engineering and Computer Science*, section 9.6. Trees with directed edges, page 206:  > *Arborescence*: A digraph G is said to be an arborescence if >  > 1. G contains no circuit—neither directed nor semicircuit. > 2. In G there is precisely one vertex v of zero in-degree. >  > This vertex v is called the *root of the arborescence*. […] >  > THEOREM 9.2. An arborescence is a tree in which every vertex other than the root has an in-degree of exactly one. > […] > An arborescence is in a sense a tree directed out of the root. Therefore an arborescence is sometimes referred to as an *out-tree*. (Reversing the direction of every edge in an arborescence will produce what may be called an *in-tree*.)  With the current definition (maximum in-degree equal to 1), it means that several vertices can have an in-degree equal to 0 instead of only the root. Which means for instance that this directed graph is currently detected as an arborescence I guess (I have never tried the `networkx` library, I have just noticed the issue in the documentation) but it should not:  > a --> b <-- c  Edit: my bad, having 2 vertices with an in-degree equal to 0 is actually impossible if the maximum in-degree of the other vertices is 1, so the definitions are equivalent. I am closing the issue.
