Hello everyone :) In the [matplotlib documentation about Collections API](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/collections_api.html) they state (somehow, it's not very clear) that the Collections act as a whole. I've talked with the developers of matplotlib and they explained me that it's a design choice not to let the users iterate this monolithic structure. So it's not a bug.  As to the alpha channels of the edges, there's a trick. Not very elegant but, at least, relies fully on the public API and without any bad workaround. It works by setting the alpha values in the RGBA notation. ```python edges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, ... ) edges.set_alpha(None) # needed up to Networkx 3.6 edges.set_color( RGBAList ) ``` Where `RGBA_List` is the list of the colors (with alpha channel) we want to assign to the edges. Unfortunately every other effort seems to make use of the internals of the `LineCollection` of matplotlib and, therefore, it's not reliable.  I hope it can help others in future :)
