BFS layout implementation#TITLE_END#Hi 👋 !  First, thank you for you work, networkx is simply an amazing package!   I wanted draw a DiGraph by using a BFS algorithm. I did not find a way to do it with the actual layouts of networkx (sorry if it's already possible!) so I quickly implemented one myself.   This is the kind of output it produces:    ![Capture d’écran 2021-11-16 à 16 51 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6132122/142024014-275a560b-08c4-42be-a9fd-5099bce86143.png)  I would understand if you disagree to merge this PR because of the specificity of the layout but I wanted to share it in case it helps someone.   Best, Matthieu.
