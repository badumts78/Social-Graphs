Exact algorithm for maximum clique set#TITLE_END#This implements exact algorithms to find a maximum independent set, a maximum clique set, a minimum vertex cover and a minimum dominating set for an undirected graph. I find that there is a module which is called Approximation to tackle these problems, but it always returns a approximation result. With fast computers we can do exponential-time computations of moderate and increasing size to seek  exact answers which will undoubtedly help to explore the interesting gap between theory and practice.  Looking forward to your comments. Thanks.
