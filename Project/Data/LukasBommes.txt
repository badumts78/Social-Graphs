issue
Match two graphs based on edit paths#TITLE_END#Hey all,  I am having two undirected graphs, A and B, without any node or edge attributes. I want to recover an error-tolerant mapping of the node labels between graph A and B. As suggested in Issue #4043 I am computing an edit path with  `nx.algorithms.similarity.optimize_edit_paths`. Now, I am wondering how to retrieve the node mapping from the node_edit/edge_edit paths.  I guess, it is trivial, but I haven't used GED before and I am not really into the theory. So, does anyone have an idea, how to do this?
comment
I'd love to see such an approximation of GED implemented in networkx as the current algorithm is really slow.
