issue
Gallery example: composite plot#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> The following code is intended to address issue number #4623   Draw a composite plot on matplotlib showing the distribution of nodes' features and the network topology at the same time.  This can be useful when you have a dataset with feature information for different items and some links between different items.

Example: spectral clustering based graph#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> **[Updated]** This example is meant to address Issue #4261 More specifically, using scikit-learn to cluster data using Spectral Clustering. Then using the adjacency matrix from the same to generate a graph for the data points to understand the clustering.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31354242/109693020-747cbd00-7b89-11eb-8924-00ea8dac57d5.png)  Follow the below thread and the issue to view the iterations of the demo.

Id love to contribute to it with @SA-networkx. We will get on it tomorrow :)

I and @ACwalker are currently working on a good general use case. 2D plot showing frequency histogram of feature and the network at the same time. - The X-axis will represent a feature value. This will be fixed for every item/node. There will be an overlapped frequency histogram on the plot. - The Y-axis will be used to project the nodes in a projection dimension to distribute nodes according to edge weights.  This can be useful when one wants to see the feature space and graph topology together.

@jarrodmillman we believe something like this would indeed be a good demonstration. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31354242/108522928-9fcff400-72cd-11eb-9ac3-1a005fb7f0a0.png)  Something to visualize the features of data while also showing the network topology according to edge weights (using `kamada_kawai_layout()`)   explanation: Here the feature vector is a gaussian distribution and the edges are picked from a uniform distribution and then we take the power of 3 (uniform_num^3), so the usage of kamada kawai algorithm is highly visible. The positions in 1 dimension obtained after `kamada_kawai_layout()` are normalised in relation to the feature vector so that everything scales properly.

@jarrodmillman I have created a draft pull request to view the code. I changed the toy example a bit and added some annotations (vlines) to make things clearer.

Hello community! I am working with @YaoM1886 and @eikNamo on this and have done some more additions to our code to make this a more complete example/demonstration.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31354242/109389713-d0d3a880-790d-11eb-96c4-cc4ffce7e60f.png)  - You can see the true data and the clustering output in the feature space. This shows the readers that although items with features can be turned into a graph, the representation won't be perfect. (this honesty is necessary). - The force-directed layout ensures the nodes will be similarly arranged with respect to the items in the feature space. - The comparison of the three additionally shows the uninitiated readers (in Data Science) the true applications of such a method: representing items in a network and creating avenues to using graph algorithms on feature-space information.

> Please label your axes. It is hard to determine what the scatterplots mean without some context.  Ah yes, it is a toy example made using scikit-learn's `datasets.make_moons()`. We will label them as feature 0 and 1 and add a legend. We are also cleaning up our code and making a draft Merge Request so that everything is a bit clearer.

> A few final suggestions but nothing super important - LGTM, thanks @ACWalker & @sharwinbobde !  @ACWalker and I are glad we could contribute!! Our team (@SA-networkx) will be working on some more issues here and creating PRs for the next few weeks :)
