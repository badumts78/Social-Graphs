issue
Problem reading GML File#TITLE_END#I have downloaded the gml file which contains the dolphins social network from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/dolphins.zip.  Some time ago I did some analysis on that network running python 3.4 and networkx 1.9 on a Windows7 machine, but now I am running on a Arch linux machine (with the same version of python but with networkx 1.10) and found an issue when tried to read the file.  This is the code used to read the file:  ``` python import networkx as nx nx.read_gml("dolphins.gml") ```  And this is the stack trace of the error:  ``` python Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> File "<string>", line 2, in read_gml File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py",line 220, in _open_file result = func(*new_args, **kwargs) File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 210, in read_gml G = parse_gml_lines(filter_lines(path), label, destringizer) File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 383, in parse_gml_lines graph = parse_graph() File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 372, in parse_graph curr_token, dct = parse_kv(next(tokens)) File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gml.py", line 323, in tokenize (line[pos:], lineno + 1, pos + 1)) networkx.exception.NetworkXError: cannot tokenize 'graph' at (1, 1) ```  Do you know what can be generating this error?
