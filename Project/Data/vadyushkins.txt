NetworkX arborescence (to and) from ETE Tree#TITLE_END#Fixes #3063  Example ```Python >>> T = nx.generate_ete(nx.path_graph(42, create_using=nx.DiGraph)) >>> G = nx.parse_ete(T) ```  All tests passed on OS Ubuntu 20.04 with  ``` Python   Version: 3.8.5 NetworkX Version: 2.6rc1.dev0 ete3     Version: 3.1.2 ```  - source code: networkx/readwrite/nx_ete.py - tests: networkx/readwrite/tests/test_ete.py  Important notes:  - In ETE [every tree has root even if the tree is conceptually considered as unrooted](http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_trees.html#root-node-on-unrooted-trees), which is consistent with the NetworkX arborescence. - Also, the ETE Tree has no edge attributes, thus edge data will be lost after conversion from NetworkX Graph.     - We can store edge information in the corresponding vertex data, but it is worth discussing. - ETE Tree has reserved node attributes `{'dist', 'name', 'support'}` and it is worth discussing how to work with them.

Adding graph/multigraph support to function `transitive_closure`#TITLE_END#Closes #5043  --- Please look for a description in related issue
issue
Refactor `transitive_closure` to support multigraphs#TITLE_END#By definition (see below and #5016) `transitive_closure` also works with multigraphs. * **transitive closure of G** is the graph G* = (V, E*), where E* = {(i, j) : there is a path from vertex i to vertex j in G}"  But now this function does not work as expected.  ### Current Behavior ```python >>> import networkx as nx >>> g = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2)]) >>> print(nx.transitive_closure(g).edges()) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "<class 'networkx.utils.decorators.argmap'> compilation 8", line 4, in argmap_transitive_closure_5   File "/home/vdshk/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/dag.py", line 576, in transitive_closure     TC.add_edges_from(edges)   File "/home/vdshk/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/networkx/classes/multigraph.py", line 550, in add_edges_from     for e in ebunch_to_add:   File "/home/vdshk/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/dag.py", line 575, in <genexpr>     edges = ((v, w) for u, w in nx.edge_dfs(G, v)) ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2) ```  ### Expected Behavior ```python >>> import networkx as nx >>> g = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2)]) >>> print(nx.transitive_closure(g).edges()) [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)] ```  ### Environment Python version: `3.8.10` NetworkX version: `2.6.2`  ### Proposal  I think this function needs to be refactored. Maybe it should be done in #5042 PR. What do you think?
