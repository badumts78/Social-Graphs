issue
to_agraph failing on node attribute name `n`#TITLE_END#I have some graph where I add the node attribute `n`  ``` G = nx.DiGraph([(1,2)]) G.node[1]['n'] = 1 nx.to_agraph(G)  networkx/drawing/nx_agraph.py:146 TypeError: add_node() got multiple values for argument 'n' ```  Is this behavior wanted? For semantic reasons I would enjoy having 'n' as a node attribute. I am aware that `G.add_node(3, n=10)` has the same behavior. This is the part of `to_agraph` where the error occurs:  ``` def to_agraph(N)     ...     # add nodes     for n,nodedata in N.nodes(data=True):         A.add_node(n,**nodedata)     ... ```  I would suggest the following change: Allow for a keyword argument to define the attributes one wants to export.  ``` def to_agraph(N, node_attr=None):     ...     # add nodes     for n,nodedata in N.nodes(data=True):         A.add_node(n,**{k: v for k,v in nodedata.values() if node_attr is None or k in node_attr})     ... ```  The argument would have to be propagated upwards to `nx.draw_networkx` etc. but would allow for an easy attributes filter.

node-link repr. contains graph dict 'as is'#TITLE_END#**Previously** The `graph` attribute dictionary was previously split into a list of key-value pairs. This resulted in a counter-intuitive JSON representation with a structure that is different from the original `graph`-dict. The only upside was the ability to use numerical keys in the dictionary which is are not supported by JSON. This enabled a mapping of the following form:  ``` G = nx.Graph() G.graph[1] = 'val' json_graph.node_link_graph(json_graph.node_link_data(G))[1] # numerical key preserved ```  **Now** With the new approach the JSON representation matches the python dict and the note in the docstring now explains the new behavior.  ``` G = nx.Graph() G.graph[1] = 'val' json_graph.node_link_graph(json_graph.node_link_data(G))['1'] # JSON has string-keys only ```  This pull request is a follow up on this [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/networkx-discuss/json/networkx-discuss/xAJsOedGg1Q/-2uCZ4mE_EEJ) on the mailing list.
