add plotting examples for geospatial examples#TITLE_END#This adds a few examples of geospatial networks for points, lines, and polygons. A few questions.   1. It makes a bit more sense to show how you build a graph built from a given type of geometric data (like, points, lines, or polygons) rather than from a specific package. I hope this makes it more clear: `geopandas` for reading, `pysal` for building the topology. @martinfleis, you may want to jump in here to demonstrate `momepy.gdf_to_nx` for LineString-based geometries? The queen graph on raw segments, while correct, is not as abstract as what folks generally want.  2. In the `plot_polygons.py` example, I opted for an online geojson dataset, rather than a built-in dataset. If that's alright, then we can proceed. I'd recommend showing that it's not quite important whether it's a shapefile, geojson, geopackage, etc. If `geopandas` can read it, it shouldn't matter.  3. Should I just commit the required files to this examples directory here? Or, is it sufficient to show that we are just reading in from a specific path? 
issue
graph from geopandas?#TITLE_END#I was wondering whether it'd be useful to implement methods to provide graphs to/from geopandas dataframes, rather than directly from shapefiles?   We've got a lightweight graph implementation for graphs in geographic data with converters [to](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L299)/[from](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L319) networkx graphs already.   I think it'd be neat if something similar could live in `networkx` as a `from_geodataframe` method, and I think it wouldn't be too hard to adapt our implementation, and I'm sure this'd be relevant/helpful to `osmnx` users and `geopandas` users alike.

I haven't seen this error before, but it looks like something easy to replicate/fix. I'll take a look. Also, tagging @martinfleis in case he can get to it sooner than me! 
comment
Yes, sorry, missed your PR about #4366, sorry! Will draft the stubbed points.
