issue
problem in spring layout#TITLE_END#Hi, I want to report an problem in the spring layout algorithm in 1.9.1, which tend to print distorted layout of network. For example, if you try the following piece of code, you will find two or three nodes are distant from the cluster, which is highly centered in the middle. I did some investigation. If the line pos=_rescale_layout(pos) is removed from the for loop in  both _sparse_fruchterman_reingold and  _fruchterman_reingold methods, then the layout will look good. I am not sure how exactly it causes the problem, but hope it helps to solve the problem in the future edition.   import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt G = nx.gnp_random_graph(100,0.2) pos=nx.spring_layout(G) nx.draw(G, pos=pos) plt.show()  yongren
