issue
Correct mu parameter documentation for LFR#TITLE_END#I've been using the networkx package and noticed this mistake on the LFR algorithm documentation.  As stated in [point 3](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/ddf06e1e89b57ee6dcc139535b4a1544e6157f4c/networkx/generators/community.py#L838) in the algorithm for LFR generation, `(1 - \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)` regards the intra-community degree of a node, which makes `mu` the fraction of inter-community degree.  Let me know if I have made a mistake in understanding this. Also, this is my first pull request, if there is anything missing just let me know. 🙂
