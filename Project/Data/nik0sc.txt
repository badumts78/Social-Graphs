issue
relabel_nodes now preserves edges in multigraphs#TITLE_END#Fixes #4058.  In a multigraph, relabeling two or more nodes that share predecessors into the same new label will preserve all edges, but will change the edge keys in the process. Previously, edge keys were not changed, but if edges ended up having the same (tail, head, key) tuple after the relabel, only one of those edges would be inserted into the relabeled graph. 
issue
relabel_nodes on MultiGraphs does not preserve both edges when two nodes are replaced by one#TITLE_END#When the graph contains edges (0,1) and (0,2), and I relabel both 1 and 2 to 3, I expected two edges from (0,3) but only one node is preserved.  Multi*Graph supports parallel edges between nodes and I expected it to preserve both edges when "merging" the two old nodes together.  Tested on both networkx 2.4 and the latest version on master.  ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0,1),(0,2)]) G[0][1][0]["value"] = "a" G[0][2][0]["value"] = "b"  print(G[0]) # Output: # {1: {0: {'value': 'a'}}, 2: {0: {'value': 'b'}}}  mapping = {1:3, 2:3}  nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping, copy=False)  print(G[0]) # Output: # {3: {0: {'value': 'b'}}} # Expected: # {3: {0: {'value': 'a'}, 1: {'value': 'b'}}} ```
