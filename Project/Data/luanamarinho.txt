[closeness.py] Should the Graph G be reversed? [edited]#TITLE_END#Hi all,  I have a few comments on the closeness_centrality function:  1. In the block comment, " **average** shortest path distance **to** `u` over all `n-1` reachable nodes" should be corrected. It's the reciprocal of the **sum** of the shortest path distances **from** u to all n-1 reachable nodes (given that u can reach itself in the distance methods)  > Closeness centrality [1]_ of a node `u` is the reciprocal of the     **average shortest path distance to `u` over all `n-1**` reachable nodes.  2. According to the definition of the variable path_length, which uses either single_source_dijkstra_path_length or single_source_shortest_path_length, the graph input G **should not be reversed**. Hence the command line `G = G.reverse()` should be erased.  3. The notes in https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.closeness_centrality.html should be revised.  Regards, Luana
