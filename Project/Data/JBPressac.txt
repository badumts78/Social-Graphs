issue
nx.Graph does not handle square matrix and the proper error code is not displayed#TITLE_END#Hello, I tried to create a bipartite graph from an adjacency matrix stored in a numpy matrix with nx.Graph and it seems that because the matrix is not square, the following error message is displayed : [NetworkXError: Input is not a correct numpy matrix or array](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/a946b38d91dd562b5b719aecb442d3965a9e5581/networkx/convert.py#L139), which should be, I guess,  [Adjacency matrix is not square.](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/a946b38d91dd562b5b719aecb442d3965a9e5581/networkx/convert_matrix.py#L268).  nx.Graph executes [from_numpy_matrix](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/a946b38d91dd562b5b719aecb442d3965a9e5581/networkx/convert_matrix.py#L204), which raise an exception in case of non-square matrix : [Adjacency matrix is not square.](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/a946b38d91dd562b5b719aecb442d3965a9e5581/networkx/convert_matrix.py#L268), but I guess that this exeption is not redirected to nx.Graph.  1. Would it be possible to implement the creation of graph from non-square matrix ? 2. Otherwise add this restriction in the documentation of nx.Graph and from_numpy_matrix and enable nx.Graph to catch the from_numpy_matrix exceptions ?  Thanks,

overlap_weighted_projected_graph incorect values for Jaccard coefficients#TITLE_END#Hello, The following code:  ``` DSW = nx.davis_southern_women_graph() DSW_jaccard = bipartite.overlap_weighted_projected_graph(DSW,DSW_women_list,jaccard=True) ```  returns a matrix with a diagonal filled with zeros while it should be filled with ones. In fact, the Jaccard value for pairs with the same person should be 1 rather than 0 (the same person is 100% similar to herself, not 0%).

Renaming weighted_projected_graph into coaffiliation_graph?#TITLE_END#Hello, I recently discovered affiliation networks throught the publication of Borgatti and Halgin, “Analyzing Affiliation Networks”. from which hoplefully derive some NetworkX functions (and I thank you for that). But I found difficult to understand that the weighted_projected_graph function was in fact linked to the co-affiliation matrix suggested in the publication. Would it be simpler to rename weighted_projected_graph as coaffiliation_graph? Thanks,
