Fix ```is_k_edge_connected``` for case of k=2#TITLE_END#Add call to ```is_connected``` in addition to ```has_bridges``` for k=2, to catch multi-component graphs without bridges, which are not not 2-edge-connected.  Fixes #7023 
issue
```is_k_edge_connected``` incorrectly returns True for k=2 with multi-component graphs without bridges#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  The implementation of ```is_k_edge_connected``` currently defers to ```is_connected``` for k=1, to ```has_bridges``` for k=2, and runs the full check for k>2.  As a result, this returns True for a multi-component graph without bridges.  ### Expected Behavior  Since the graph has multiple components, it is not connected in the first place and ```is_k_edge_connected``` should return False for all (positive) values of k.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ``` import networkx as nx  G = nx.compose(nx.complete_graph([0, 1, 2]), nx.complete_graph([3, 4, 5])) nx.connectivity.is_k_edge_connected(G, 2) ```  This returns True but should return False.  ### Environment  Python version: 3.11.2 NetworkX version: 3.1  ### Additional context  As defined in the NetworkX documentation, a bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components. It appears to me, then, that a graph not having bridges is a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition for a graph being 2-edge-connected.
