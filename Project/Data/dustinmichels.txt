Mutation troubles with copy and set_node_attributes#TITLE_END#Hi! I've been having some troubles with node attributes and graph copies. Here is a MWE; G2 is a copy of G1 and changing an attribute of G2 also changing G1:  ```python import networkx as nx  g_dict = {'a':'b'} g_vals = {'a':[1,2],'b':[1,2]}  G1 = nx.Graph(g_dict) nx.set_node_attributes(G1, name='stuff', values=g_vals) G2 = G1.copy()  print('G1:', G1.nodes(True)) print('G2:', G2.nodes(True))  G2.nodes['a']['stuff'].remove(1)  print('G2:', G2.nodes(True)) print('G1:', G1.nodes(True))  # OUTPUT: # G1: [('a', {'stuff': [1, 2]}), ('b', {'stuff': [1, 2]})] # G2: [('a', {'stuff': [1, 2]}), ('b', {'stuff': [1, 2]})] # G2: [('a', {'stuff': [2]}), ('b', {'stuff': [1, 2]})] # G1: [('a', {'stuff': [2]}), ('b', {'stuff': [1, 2]})] ```   Perhaps I misunderstood something, but: - [The documentation for `set_node_attributes`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.set_node_attributes.html) says "If `values` is not a dictionary, then...updates to that object will be reflected in the node attribute for each edge." So I make sure to use a dictionary!  - [The documentation for `Graph.copy`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.copy.html#networkx-graph-copy) says "the default behavior is a 'deepcopy' where the graph structure as well as all data attributes and any objects they might contain are copied."  Which made me think this was the way to copy and then change a graph's node attributes?
