I am using jupyter notebooks to display networkx graphs with `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` and then passing axis to `nx.draw(..., ax=ax)` and was not able to display the xticks and yticks without altering the code from the issue. That is, various permuatations of `ax.set_xticklabels(...)`, `ax.set_xticks(...)` after `ax.axis('on')` did not work (e.g. [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11244514/modify-tick-label-text) did not work).  What worked was: ``` # Changed here plt.tick_params(axis='both',               which='both',               bottom=True,               left=True,               labelbottom=True,               labelleft=True) ``` Not sure why normal adjustment of xticks with `ax` didn't work. Just posting here in case it helps someone else.
