issue
all_node_cuts stuck when load of work is high#TITLE_END#Hi.  I have a dataframe (pandas) with many rows, I then groupby the df by using an indicator and using every group as a graph.  While receiving other features (is_connected, number_connected_components, ...) works well. Trying to apply all_node_cuts fails.  short debuting showed that it stopped after around 1000 rows (or around 300 of groups).  The code:  ``` def create_bipartite_graph(df):     G = nx.Graph()     G.add_nodes_from(df['device'].values, bipartite=0)     G.add_nodes_from(df['screen'].values, bipartite=1)     G.add_weighted_edges_from([tuple(x) for x in df[['device', 'screen', 'weight']].values])     return G  def assign_graph_properties2(df):     G = create_bipartite_graph(df)     node_cuts = 0 if not nx.is_connected(G) else len(list(nx.all_node_cuts(G)))     return pd.DataFrame([node_cuts] * len(df))  c = d.groupby(by=['user'])[['device', 'screen', 'weight']].apply(func=assign_graph_properties2).values ```  After way many hours of trying things, I would love to get any advise what's wrong.
