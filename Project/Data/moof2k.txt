While exploring upgrading to networkx >= 1.7 I stumbled upon an issue where performing an in-place relabel of one of my graphs was triggering this error:  `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`  Digging deeper, I discovered the issue was the change to `relabel_nodes()` attached to #687:  ```             new_edges = [(new, old == target and new or target, data)                          for (_,target,data) in edges] ```  The equality check `==` is triggering the ValueError when comparing a tuple made of numpy.int32 with a tuple of another type. Here's a simple example:  ``` >>> a = tuple(np.array([0,1], dtype=np.int32)) >>> b = ((0,0), 1) >>> a == b Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all() ```  I believe the intent of this code is to check for loops in the graph by detecting nodes that have already been mapped; changing the `==` operator to `is` I believe keeps the intent but resolves this issue of comparing mixed numpy types.
