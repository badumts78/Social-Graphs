issue
Long import times#TITLE_END#Using [**import_profiler**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/import-profiler/0.0.3), I've traced slow imports to **networkx**, especially:  * `networkx.generators` (300ms) * `networkx.linalg` <- `.algebraicconnectivity` <- `numpy` (200ms) * `networkx.readwrite` <- `.graphml` <- `xml.etree.cElementTree` (100ms)  I'm not using `linalg` at all, and I rarely need `readwrite`. I don't think I need `generators` either. These three trees represent 60% of the import-time for **networkx**.  When my filesystem is slow, the import-times can be much worse.  I have a couple of ideas for you: * If possible, avoid importing these unless they are needed. * Or, depend on and use [**lazy-import**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazy-import) for at least these 3 sub-trees.

networkx causes its own warning#TITLE_END#I understand from #3230 that python2 is no longer supported. However, my *goal* is to switch to python3, and in order to achieve that I am first running `python2.7 -3 -Werror ...` on my own code. I cannot do this because networx warns about networkx: ```py   File "/scratch/cdunn/.git/BASE/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/classes/digraph.py", line 1180, in reverse     H = self.fresh_copy()   File "/scratch/cdunn/.git/BASE/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py", line 1446, in fresh_copy     warnings.warn(msg, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2) DeprecationWarning: G.fresh_copy is deprecated. Use G.__class__ instead ``` This really causes a problem in migration.

> I typically put import scipy inside functions, but I think there is an argument for assuming numpy globally...  I completely disagree with that. This is a graph library, not a numerics library. Anyway, I'll look at this again someday after this is released.

True. But it's unfortunate that we are forced to load things we do not need.  The real problem was that, long ago, all components were star-imported into the top module, and many others recursively, for convenience. That was a mistake, I think inarguably. Now we're looking for work-arounds. If **scipy** is no longer load, that should help.
