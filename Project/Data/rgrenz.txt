graphviz_layout fails with certain node labels#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior When trying to layout a graph using nx_pydot.graphviz_layout, all nodes with labels of the form "A:B" that share the same prefix "A" are positioned at the same coordinates.  ### Expected Behavior The node labels should be properly escaped during the layout procedure, and should not share the same position on the final layout.  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_edges_from([     (1, "Example:A"),     (2, "Example:B"), ]) pos = nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(G) nx.draw(G, pos, labels={node: node for node in G.nodes()}) ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82824798/170236870-0182c34e-e0f0-4059-825b-a456c44a318f.png)  This does not occur when changing ":" to another separator like "_": ``` G = nx.Graph() G.add_edges_from([     (1, "Example_A"),     (2, "Example_B"), ]) pos = nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(G) nx.draw(G, pos, labels={node: node for node in G.nodes()}) ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82824798/170237188-213ff2ca-bb0e-4639-9d84-bddb4ec8126d.png)  ### Environment Python version: 3.8.13 NetworkX version: 2.8
