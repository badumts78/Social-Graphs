total nodes of composed graph is more than sum of nodes for each subgraph#TITLE_END#I scratched my head for a couple of ours, until I found this strange result in my code: total nodes of a composed graph is more than sum of nodes for each subgraph.  Could you help me explain how **compose_all** and **subgraph** methods works?  I'll tell you what I do:  ``` def induce_Subgraph(graph, fromNode, toNode):       graphs = []           // I extract some paths in graph, and then I extract a subgraph according to the path      graphs.append( graph.subgraph(path) )      // I repeat it, then merge all graphs induced from the original one      graph = nx.compose_all( graphs)      return graph ```  Now, I found out that the sum of nodes for each subgraphs is less then the total nodes in the induced graph made with function above. ``` x = set() for graph in graphs :  	for node in graph.nodes(): 		x.add( node ) x = len(x) graph = nx.compose_all( graphs ) y = len(graph.nodes() print('total graph nodes, ', y, x )  // y > x  ```  I could not figure out why. I was expecting subgraph would return a new graph like this pseudo-code: ``` for u, v in make_pairs( path ):      g = nx.Graph()      g.addEdge(u, v) ```  I want to also copy attributes of the edge, that's why I was happy for using subgraph.  What compose_all in the example above should contains more nodes than sum of nodes in subgraphs ?

Girvan Newman community detection not defined#TITLE_END#Hi guys! I want to undertand better community detection algorithms, I would like to try girvan newman on my data structure.  I read that is implemented in nx: http://networkx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.centrality.girvan_newman.html  But I found now way to run it:  > > > g = nx.path_graph(10) > > > comp = girvan_newman(g) > > > Traceback (most recent call last): > > >   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> > > > NameError: name 'girvan_newman' is not defined  (Instead, nx.k_clique_communities() is working)  Could you please debrief? Here running latest version 1.10.  Thank you!
