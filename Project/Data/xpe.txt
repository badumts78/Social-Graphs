Lack of library-wide ordered set hurts readability of algorithms#TITLE_END#**Updated as of 2020-04-12 1:41pm PDT**  **Problem**  There is at least one place in NetworkX that uses [collections.OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) as a substitute for an insertion-ordered set. This is an undesirable workaround: it makes code harder than necessary to read.  Consider this example:  ```py visited[child] = None ```  What do you think it does? I wouldn't fault anyone for (on a first pass) thinking that it marks `child` as not visited. Well, in reality, **adds** an item to an collections.OrderedDict (used as an insertion-ordered set).  In my view, the above code doesn't just "read badly" it is also misleading. In context of a particular algorithm, [simple_paths.py][1], it makes it harder to follow.

I understand that Python's collections library does not provide an ordered set container. I recommend either:  * using an existing ordered set library, or * add a library-wide wrapper on top of OrderedDict.  For example, please consider [IndexedSet from the boltons package](https://boltons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setutils.html#boltons.setutils.IndexedSet):  > IndexedSet is a collections.MutableSet that maintains insertion order and uniqueness of inserted elements. It’s a hybrid type, mostly like an OrderedSet, but also list-like, in that it supports indexing and slicing.

Incorrectly returning [] when a generator is expected#TITLE_END#This return value (`[]`) is not consistent with the intention of the `all_simple_paths` function:  ```py if source in targets:     return [] ```  From: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/b0ca6ce081cc6e66d509c5f7fed60728da821c25/networkx/algorithms/simple_paths.py#L230  Context:  ```py def all_simple_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=None):     """Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target.     A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.      [...]      Returns     -------     path_generator: generator        A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths        between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator        produces no output. ```  I recommend, instead, that NetworkX provide a reusable empty generator function, such as:  ```py def empty_generator():     yield from () ```  Then, in `all_simple_paths` (and almost certainly, other places in the library), call `return empty_generator()`
