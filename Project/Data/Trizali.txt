bipartite.projected_graph loses edge information#TITLE_END#Hi everyone,  I have a bipartite network 'g' with nodes from set X and R. When I launch the projection to get the graph with the nodes of set R, it works perfectly. However, I lose the edge information. I would like to know how I can retrieve the edge information and add them to the R set projection graph, so in which I can have the name of the edges with the nodes of the X set.   ``` ## The directed bipartite graph g = json_graph.node_link_graph(graph_data, directed=True)  ## Draw the projection set R graph g_over_r = bipartite.projected_graph(g, r_set)  pos = nx.layout.spring_layout(g_over_r) nx.draw(g_over_r, pos=pos, edge_labels=labels_edge) nx.draw_networkx_labels(g_over_r, pos=pos)  ```  I tried add this, but does not work: ``` labels_edge = {(s,t): data['label'] for s,t, data in g.edges(data=True)} nx.draw_networkx_labels(g_over_r, pos=pos, labels=labels_edge)  #[(n, nbrdict) for n, nbrdict in g.adjacency()] ```   Thank you in advance
