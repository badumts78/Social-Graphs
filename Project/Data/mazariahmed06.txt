Apply graph rotation with 90 degree and permutation#TITLE_END#Hello,  Now l would like to permute nodes and rotate the graph with (80°, 90°,120° degree)  How can l apply permutation and rotation on graphs with NetworkX ?   Given an adjacency matrix of a graph, l would like to rotate the graph in the way that it preserves the edges and vertices link. The only thing that changes is the position of nodes.  What l would like to do is to rotate my graph with 90 degree.  Input :  Adjacency matrix of graph G  process :  Apply rotation on G with 90 degree  Output :  Rotated adjacency matrix  It means, the graph preserves its topology and just the index of adjacency matrix that changes position.  For example nodes 1 at index 0 after rotation will be at index 4 for instance.    Thank you
