[BUG] Inappropriate `out_edge` return when node type is str#TITLE_END#If you use `int` as the node type, and apply `G.out_edges` to a nonexisting node, it throws an exception (perhaps because the input is understood as `nbunch`) ``` G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edge(1, 2) G.out_edges(1) Out[9]: OutEdgeDataView([(1, 2)]) G.out_edges(3) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\graph.py", line 1908, in bunch_iter     for n in nlist: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\IPython\core\interactiveshell.py", line 3296, in run_code     exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)   File "<ipython-input-10-1253e8a219cb>", line 1, in <module>     G.out_edges(3)   File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\reportviews.py", line 936, in __call__     return self.dataview(self, nbunch, data, default)   File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\reportviews.py", line 648, in __init__     nbunch = list(viewer._graph.nbunch_iter(nbunch))   File "D:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\graph.py", line 1916, in bunch_iter     raise NetworkXError(msg) networkx.exception.NetworkXError: nbunch is not a node or a sequence of nodes. ``` But when the type is `str`, you get nothing but an empty edge view. This is probably because `str` is iterable but `int` is not. I think these inconsistent behaviors makes users prone to bugs.
