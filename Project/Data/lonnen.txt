add recommended venv directory to .gitignore#TITLE_END#CONTRIBUTING.rst recommends creating a virtual env in the directory `networkx-dev/`. This change adds that directory to `.gitignore`  Fixes #4618 - recommended virtual env name should be in .gitignore 
issue
recommended virtual env name should be in .gitignore#TITLE_END#`CONTRIBUTING.rst` recommends creating a virtual env in the repository with the name `networkx-dev/`. Git treats this venv is treated as a new directory and set of candidate repository additions.   ### Current Behavior Git lists the virtual env in its set of untracked files. VSCode's Git extension warns that there are "too many active changes, only a susbet of Git features will be enabled."  ### Expected Behavior Git should be preset to ignore this virtual environment.  ### Steps to Reproduce Checkout the repository. Follow the virtual environment steps of `CONTRIBUTING.rst`. Open the directory in a a vanilla copy of VSCode or run `git status`  ### Environment Python version: 3.7 pip version: 21.0.1 NetworkX version: 37f63fb7d95617493184a4c2444b69da867fb715 (latest master at time of writing) VSCode: 1.53.2 MacOS Big Sur 11.1 running on a 16 inch MBP (2019)  ### Additional context * should other files be ignored for the conda setup? 
issue
`clique.graph_clique_number` should return earlier when the graph has no nodes#TITLE_END#`clique.graph_clique_number` could be faster by a small constant time improvement  ### Current Behavior  When clique.graph_clique_number` is called with a node-free graph it runs `find_cliques` before checking for an empty graph and returning early. Intuitively, `find_cliques` can be quite expensive though in this case it is guaranteed to return immediately on an empty graph.  ### Expected Behavior  It's a very small optimization, but `graph_clique_number` could check and early return could come before the call to `find_cliques`.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ```python G = networkx.Graph() networkx.algorithms.clique.graph_clique_number(G) ```

return earlier from `clique.graph_clique_number`#TITLE_END#Fixes issue #4621 by moving an early return opportunity earlier into the method call, potentially avoiding one function call to `find_cliques` that otherwise returns early, itself

Fix graph_clique_number for clique-less graphs#TITLE_END#- empty graphs return 0 - graphs with at least one vertex and no cliques return 1  - add test cases for each  fixes https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3050
issue
`algorithms.clique.graph_clique_number` fails for graphs without cliques#TITLE_END#If you pass a graph without cliques into the `algorithms.clique.graph_clique_number` function you'll get an unexpected ValueError. Something like this:  ``` ====================================================================== ERROR: test_clique.TestCliques.test_clique_number2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ...stuff...   File "/Users/lonnen/repos/networkx/networkx/algorithms/clique.py", line 426, in graph_clique_number     return max([len(c) for c in cliques]) ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence ```  I expect it to return 0 when there are no cliques in the graph

As I understand it the graph_edit_distance function does not consider labels, and your result reflects only substituting the edge.  Here is how I decided that --  If you look into the [source code](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/7ae7f0146a33e340acbabe5a11d297e8187cb6d8/networkx/algorithms/similarity.py#L163): ```python 	bestcost = None 	for vertex_path, edge_path, cost in optimize_edit_paths(...): 		bestcost = cost 	return bestcost ```  The `optimize_edit_paths(...)` function is the source of the 'cost' parameter, so let's look at that:  ```python     paths = list()     bestcost = None     for vertex_path, edge_path, cost in optimize_edit_paths(         G1,         G2, 		#...removed kwargs that are not useful to us...     ):         # assert bestcost is None or cost <= bestcost         if bestcost is not None and cost < bestcost:             paths = list()         paths.append((vertex_path, edge_path))         bestcost = cost     return paths, bestcost ```  This function gets edit paths and costs, but those paths do not contain any label information. They only have structural data about edges and nodes. That leads me to think that maybe labels are not considered. If you want to be certain, then we have to look at the function that returns the cost info: [`optimize_edit_paths()`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/7ae7f0146a33e340acbabe5a11d297e8187cb6d8/networkx/algorithms/similarity.py#L498)  ```python def optimize_edit_paths(     G1,     G2,     node_match=None,     edge_match=None,     node_subst_cost=None,     node_del_cost=None,     node_ins_cost=None,     edge_subst_cost=None,     edge_del_cost=None,     edge_ins_cost=None,     upper_bound=None,     strictly_decreasing=True, ):     """GED (graph edit distance) calculation: advanced interface. 	...""" ```  The documentation there is extensive and lays out what each of these arguments does. One of the arguments, `edge_match`, tells us it should be `A function that returns True if the edge attribute dictionaries for the pair of nodes (u1, v1) in G1 and (u2, v2) in G2 should be considered equal during matching.`.  If you keep tracing through library code you'll eventually find [`match_edges(...)`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/7ae7f0146a33e340acbabe5a11d297e8187cb6d8/networkx/algorithms/similarity.py#L685) used in [`get_edit_ops(...)`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/7ae7f0146a33e340acbabe5a11d297e8187cb6d8/networkx/algorithms/similarity.py#L774).  And you can keep going like that if you'd like, but it's easy to get lost diving into a complex and unfamiliar function like this. Especially when you're looking for something that is missing. You can search, but it is hard to search for the absence of something without having to understand it completely. At this point I decided I wouldn't look any deeper.  From what I can see, there is no documentation or code anywhere here that mentions or examines labels and the function `optimize_edit_paths` returns costs associated only with structural edges and nodes, so I don't believe labels are considered.

I'm not really a maintainer of this repo, though, so I must defer to @jwegis (👋) to decide how to resolve this issue
