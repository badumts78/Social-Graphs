I have a small example in which this happens Contained in Shapes.zip.  Export_output.shp is the shape before converting to a NX graph. Edges.shp is the output from NX after converting the original shape to a graph then back to a shapefile.  One edge is lost, but no manipulations are done to the graph.  There is another case where when converting from a DiGraph to a UnDiGraph i lose multiple more edges.  it will be included in Shapes2.zip When converting to DiGraph we lose the same edge again, then when covnerting to UnDiGraph we lose a few more. [shapes.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/817328/shapes.zip) [Shapes2.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/817348/Shapes2.zip)  My code: ``` 	G = nx.read_shp(inPth) 	G = G.to_undirected() 	writeGraph(G, outPth) ```  where inPth is the path of the shapefile to read and outPth is the path where it is to be written.
