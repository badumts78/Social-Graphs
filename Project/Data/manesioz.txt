Speed-up of graph/multi-graph methods #TITLE_END#Addresses #3687  
issue
Updated String Formatting and Error Messages #TITLE_END#Updated error messages, accomplishes the following:   - Uses proper string formatting conventions consistently (i.e. "{}".format(var) instead of "%s" % var)  - Uses the actual graph alias instead of the default "G", which makes the error more clear and easier to trace back if you are dealing with multiple graphs  
issue
Issue with the separation of dijkstra_path and dijkstra_path_length functions #TITLE_END#Hello,  I was wondering if there was any reason to separate `dijkstra_path()` and `dijkstra_path_length()` into separate functions? Since we can see from the [source code](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py#L162) that we are only returning part of the information in `dijkstra_path()`:   ```python  (length, path) = single_source_dijkstra(G, source, target=target,weight=weight) return path ``` Which means that if the user wants to find the path length in addition to the path itself, one would have to call the other function `dijkstra_path_length()`, thereby increasing the computational overhead unnecessarily.   Wouldn't it be easier to return a NamedTuple of both path and length and let the user parse the information accordingly? 
comment
Can you give a specific case when the function would be stuck in an infinite loop? 
comment
To generalize this you essentially want a function to calcluate the cost of *any* arbitrary path, not necessarily the shortest one (relative to your weight).  Surprisingly there doesn't seem to be any general function for this (`all_simple_paths()` is close but it generates paths unnecessarily, we already have a single one in mind), but it seems like it would be easy to implement (using the available `traversal` methods). What do you think? 
comment
I was thinking of also implementing some error checking to determine if the sequence of nodes is valid before we blindly compute the cost but I noticed that I don't think there's a function that accepts a sequence of nodes and a graph ([here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9.1/_modules/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/generic.html#has_path) we see `has_path()` which accepts a start and end node, but in this case we care about the intermediary nodes) so do you think it would be helpful to implement that as well? 
comment
I'm not sure what you're asking, but there is an implementation of the [GN algorithm](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.centrality.girvan_newman.html) if you were looking for that.

Would it be possible to show us the actual list of nodes and edges connected to the above points (the 9, 7, and 6 ones respectively)? It's possible that the visualization is not perfectly reflective of the actual graph relationships (depending on how you rendered/coloured it). For example, in OSM, some Ways span multiple Nodes which could account for the greater-than-anticipated degree centrality for some nodes.
