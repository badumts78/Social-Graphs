issue
Problem in having different labelling options#TITLE_END#I have a graph that consists of three sets of nodes 1. servers 2. stations 3. users I want to draw them with networks built-in visualization. In the drawing, I want to have the labels for users and stations but not for servers. However, this doesn't work. when I try this:  ``` nx.draw_networkx_nodes(network,                     with_labels=False,                     nodelist=self.servers_idx,                     node_size=50, node_shape='s',                     pos=servers_pos,                     node_color='r') nx.draw_networkx_nodes(network, with_labels=True,                     nodelist=self.stations_idx,                     node_size=50, node_shape='^',                     pos=stations_pos,                     node_color='g') nx.draw_networkx_nodes(network, with_labels=True,                     nodelist=self.users_idx,                     node_size=10, node_shape='o',                     pos=users_pos,                     node_color='b') ```  I get the following figure:   ![Rn2fF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6298780/79459121-b5f49000-7fea-11ea-8180-58162c8da24d.png)  which as you see shows none of the labels, but I have set the `with_labels` variable value to `True` for stations and users and the expectation is that it will show them. The strange thing is that when I set all the `with_labels` to `True` it will show all the labels. But if I only set one of them to `False` it will not show the other two (like that I have set all of them `False`). Does anyone have any idea what is happening here?
