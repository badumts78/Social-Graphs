issue
Why are draw() results so different from spring_layout + draw_networkx results?#TITLE_END#Everything I've seen says that nx.draw() uses spring_layout with its default parameter values. Yet I'm getting wildly different results when I try nx.draw() versus nx.draw_networkx using pos=spring_layout, where the draw() graphs have a FAR superior overall layout and organization of related nodes.  My two approaches:  nx.draw(graph, with_labels=True) creates this result, which perfectly displays the node and sub-node links in a readable tree-like structure:  ![nx.draw only](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbf3d77b-7ecc-4e02-ac45-3ad0be8c3eeb)  pos=nx.spring_layout(graph) nx.draw_networkx(graph, pos, with_labels=True) These create pretty horrific and unintelligle graph of the same data in an elliptical layout:  ![spring_layout and draw_detworkx()](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3894a9db-3e10-4abf-953a-09fb64eb07a6)  If this is not truly an issue, can someone help me understand why draw() only is so superior when it claims to use spring_layout for its positions? If draw() really is using default spring_layout, shouldn't these graphs' basic shapes be very similar?  (The reason I'm asking this is because I need to use the explicit pos=nx.spring_layout(graph) with nx.draw_networkx(graph, pos, with_labels=True) approach because I will eventually need to add edge labels using the same pos.)
