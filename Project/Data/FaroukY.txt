Densest Subgraph Problem: FISTA based algorithm + Large scale tests. #TITLE_END#This PR builds on the work from PR #7731, specifically addressing Future Work point 1: implementing the algorithm from [3], which provides enhanced scalability and improved runtime performance.  The implemented algorithm demonstrates notable advantages over Greedy++, both in the number of iterations required to converge to the densest subgraph and, more importantly, in the vectorizability of each iteration, resulting in significant performance gains. For instance, in the "close_cliques" test case, this algorithm (FISTA) is 26 times faster than Greedy++.  For example, on a graph with around 3,300 vertices, and around 100,000 edges, it finds the densest subgraph in ~0.2 seconds compared to Greedy++ which takes ~12 seconds. My implementation is based on my original paper [3].  That said, Greedy++ remains relevant, as it can converge faster than FISTA on certain graphs, particularly those with highly imbalanced degree distributions.   Finally, the PR refactors the tests and adds more scalability test cases.       [3] Harb, Elfarouk, Kent Quanrud, and Chandra Chekuri.

Densest Subgraph Problem: Greedy Peeling and Greedy++ Implementations#TITLE_END#This PR introduces two popular algorithms for solving the [Densest Subgraph Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subgraph) (DSG), which is a foundational problem in graph theory with a wide range of applications. Dense subgraphs often provide insights into network structures, such as community detection, and can serve as a key subroutine in unsupervised clustering techniques.   While the problem is exactly solvable in Polynomial Time via a reduction to maximum flow (commonly referred to as Goldberg's algorithm), the algorithm is quite involved and not scalable for large-scale graphs. For example, authors from [2] noted that the Goldberg’s algorithm failed on many large graphs even though they used a highly optimized maximum flow library. Due to the importance of the problem and solving it on large graphs, there are several known approximation algorithms for the problem.   # Algorithms Implemented:  1. Greedy Peeling: Based on Charikar's classical algorithm [1], this is a simple and effective approach to approximating the densest subgraph and is a 1/2 approximation. 2. Greedy++: From a more recent work [2], this method builds on Greedy Peeling and achieves significantly better performance on large-scale graphs. The algorithm is a $(1-\epsilon)$ approximation after $O(\Delta(G)\log n/\epsilon^2)$ iterations. In practice, it converges quite fast. See for example [3].   # Future Work:  1. Implement the algorithm from [3], which offers further improvements in scalability and runtime. 2. Optimize Greedy++ by implementing a linked list-based approach, enabling key operations to be performed in $O(1)$ time instead of $O(\log n)$ time. While the heap-based approach used here is efficient, the constant factor difference between linked lists and heaps becomes significant for massive graphs (e.g., billions of edges). 3. Implement the exact algorithm (Goldberg's algorithm).   # Notes  These implementations focus on correctness and scalability, with Greedy++ already demonstrating excellent performance on large-scale graphs. In subsequent PRs, additional optimizations and advanced algorithms will be included, ensuring support for even larger datasets and more efficient runtime.    # References      [1] Charikar, Moses.

Hi @rossbar, I looked at it and it looks good to me, thank you for the refactor. I didn't even realise I was using that "close_cliques_example" in two different tests (with different parameters), so nice spot!
