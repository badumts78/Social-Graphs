issue
spring_layout does not respect `fixed` parameter#TITLE_END#I am attempting to use the spring layout with some of the graph's nodes fixed in a particular location to match someone else's algorithm.  However, the code does not seem to be respecting this option.  A minimum working example is below:  ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge(0,1) G.add_edge(0,2) G.add_edge(1,2) pos = nx.spring_layout(G, pos = {G.nodes()[0]:(0.5,0.5)}, fixed = [0]) print pos ```  This returns  ``` {0: array([ 0.,  0.]), 1: array([ 0.37384002,  0.44595047]), 2: array([ 0.20519677,  1.        ])} ```  where instead it should return `{0: array([0.5,0.5])}`.
