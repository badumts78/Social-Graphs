A typo in documentation#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: NetworkX version:  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->  In the page "https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-2.1/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.structuralholes.effective_size.html?highlight=effective_size#networkx.algorithms.structuralholes.effective_size", it tells a name called "efficency" . However, in Bert theory, it is "efficiency". It is a typo, I recommend you to fix it.
