Clustering coefficient of weighted graph#TITLE_END#Hi! I'm trying to use networkx.algorithms.cluster.clustering to calculate the clustering coefficient of a weighted network. I noticed that the formula listed in the networkx reference is slightly different from the formula in the paper being cited [1]. Could I ask why?  In the [networkx reference](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cluster.clustering.html#networkx.algorithms.cluster.clustering), the constant number in the numerator is 1. In the paper[1], that constant number is 2.   I believe it should be 2, as it should be adapted from the calculation of all possible triangles, namely deg(u)(deg(u-1))/2.   Thanks!
