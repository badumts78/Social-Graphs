issue
Met this error (Segmentation fault (core dumped))#TITLE_END#hello I am trying to find all the cycles in the a digraph, So I use this method: `nx.simple_cycles(G)` It works fine and fast when I have 5000 edges in G and 60 cycles, but when I try to test it with larger dataset, say 300000 edges and 150000 cycles, It pops out Segmentation fault (core dumped).  My computer configuration is I5 CPU and 8G memory.  I kown that simple_cycles implement jhonson's algorithm and this should be the fastest algorithm. So what makes the weak performance when it comes large graph?  Thanks!
