> Multiplying by the aspect ratio whenever we have the ratio of x and y doesn't seem to work if I understood you correctly. **I tried various combinations of setting up the figure to try to find out why some cases failed but others didn't but haven't been able to figure it out**. I think someone with some more knowledge of matplotlib might need to take a look. Here is the full code of the function and something to test it with.  Have you tried to transform y-coordinates using [`ax._get_aspect_ratio()`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/v3.7.0/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L8275) when calculating x-related variables and vice-versa?  I mean:  ``` Python # calculate the quadratic bezier curve control point cx = (x1 + x2) / 2 + rad * (y2 - y1) * ax._get_aspect_ratio() cy = (y1 + y2) / 2 - rad * (x2 - x1) / ax._get_aspect_ratio() ```

Just for the record, it seems that changing those two lines does solve the problem.  <details>   <summary>your working examples</summary>    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219785822-9cd2e35b-7e1f-4895-b42c-1921eabeb000.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219785844-45d59d1c-65f8-44e1-836e-e4c8257ab806.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219785878-0002c792-e99f-4393-a5f9-a4ea149ebf3e.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219785903-2617b28a-4b57-4dad-963d-e4e979f8d5c7.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219785926-a024a17c-a554-4c62-8f86-26dacdd7fe9a.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219785961-6ac7c4cd-92d6-48c8-8a9e-65bc672f2eb5.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219786000-5c4c00c7-9df2-4cd8-a8d4-c69669e0500f.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64039817/219786028-3b9e8ee2-b7a5-461d-96e0-8636b29a7a15.png)  </details>
