issue
write_gml doesn't wait until file is properly written to disk in all cases#TITLE_END#I have a setup where I write a graph to a gml file and immediately afterwards read it with another tool which is not of importance for this issue.  it happens in about 5% of the cases that the gml file is not completely written to disk before the next command (the reading process) is called.  I can see the decorator @open_file(1, mode='wb') [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/57e96144d58cb8d47fc0780aa798e110944798e6/networkx/readwrite/gml.py#L672) but dont have time to look furrtherly into the decorator [code](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/57e96144d58cb8d47fc0780aa798e110944798e6/networkx/utils/decorators.py#L156)  Is there sth that can be done in the decorator to avoid this behaviour?
