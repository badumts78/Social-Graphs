Going back many years, here is the description I have:  Re the ordering in Graph Atlas:  the graphs are listed:  1) in increasing order of number of nodes; 2) for a fixed number of nodes, in increasing order of the number of edges; 3) for fixed numbers of nodes and edges, in increasing order of the degree sequence, for example 111223 < 112222; 4) for fixed degree sequence, in increasing number of automorphisms. 5) In NetworkX, indexing is set up so that for GAG=graph_atlas_g(),    then G123=GAG[123] and G[0]=empty_graph(0)  Pieter Swart  On Wed, May 18, 2016 at 6:37 AM, chebee7i notifications@github.com wrote:  > Oh Read!
