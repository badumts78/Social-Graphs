issue
Don't import other people's version.py#TITLE_END#fix #4288  When a repository calls import networkx it will trigger a sequence of imports that will cause to look for a version.py in the current working directory. Because it is common for a repository to contain a version.py, this will end up being executed.  The change guarantees that this library version.py is called.  Arguably, the line of code should not being called at all when importing networkx.  <!-- Please run black to format your code.
