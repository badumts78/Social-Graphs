issue
Node attributes as functions of other nodes#TITLE_END#Being able to set node attributed that update automatically based on, for example, parent nodes' attributes, doesn't seem to be implemented directly. I.e:   ``` G.add_node(0, att = 1) G.add_node(1, att=G.node[0]['att']+1) G.node ```  gives `{0: {'att': 1}, 1: {'att': 2}}`, but performing  ``` G.node[0]['att'] += 1 G.node ``` gives `{0: {'att': 2}, 1: {'att': 2}}`, meaning that the  attribute is not referencing the other node directly, but sets the value at instantiation.   Are there any ways around this, other than having to make a separate class+variable for this attribute (making the attribute a class instance) or constantly updating the attributes with `set_node_attributes()` and a dict full of functions?   I'm wanting to store variables as nodes and represent functional relationships with edges, programmatically  inserting node "parents" into some kind of node attribute function.
