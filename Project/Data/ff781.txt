Shortest path with weight=weight_function not uniquely identifying MultiEdges#TITLE_END#```py import networkx as nx  # Create a multidigraph G = nx.MultiDiGraph()  # Add edges with different weights G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=5, key=0) G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=2, key=1)  def f(u, v, d):     print(u,v,d)     return 1  # Find the shortest path shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(G, source=0, target=1, weight=f) #shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(G, source=0, target=1, weight='weight') path_length = nx.shortest_path_length(G, source=0, target=1, weight='weight')  print(f"Shortest path: {shortest_path}") print(f"Path length: {path_length}") print(f"Edge data: {G.get_edge_data(0, 1)}") ```  Shortest path (djikstra by default), works fine with multigraphs and a single scalar weight value, but when using a function for the weight, only passes u,v,dict key->data, which makes it impossible in the weight_function to distinguish which multiedge is currently selected.  ```py 0 1 {0: {'weight': 5}, 1: {'weight': 2}} 0 1 {0: {'weight': 5}, 1: {'weight': 2}} Shortest path: [0, 1] Path length: 2 Edge data: {0: {'weight': 5}, 1: {'weight': 2}} ```  i.e. this is the current output of the above code, while both multiedges are correctly traversed, they both get the same key->data dict, and thus it is not trivial to return the correct weight value.  A more reasonable behaviour would be to use the weight_function(u,v,k,d) or weight_function(u,v,{k:d}).
