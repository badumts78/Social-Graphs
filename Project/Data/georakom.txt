Add `all_triangles` generator yielding all unique triangles in a graph#TITLE_END#Implemented an `all_triangles` function that efficiently yields all unique triangles in an undirected graph. The algorithm follows a "Forward" principle by enforcing a node ordering to avoid redundant comparisons and double-counting. For each node u, it examines neighbors v > u and yields triangles formed by the intersection of u's and v's neighbors that are greater than v.  The function optionally supports a nodes parameter, restricting enumeration to triangles where all three nodes are in the specified set.  This is my first pull request here and I would gladly appreciate any comments and improvements!
