Bug: Inconsistency between edges() and adjancency_matrix(G)#TITLE_END#* networkx == (2.4, 2.3, 2.2) * python == 3.7.5 * OS == Ubuntu 18.04  Hi, Thank you for developing a wonderful library. I found an unexpected output when getting an adjancency matrix from a graph. Is it a bug?  the following code is a minimal reproducible code. ```python #!/usr/bin/env python                                                                                                                                                                             import networkx as nx                                                                                                                                                                             G = nx.Graph()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      edges = [(1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7)]                                                                                                                                  G.add_edges_from(edges)                                                                                                                                                                           print(nx.to_numpy_matrix(G))                                                                                                                                                                      print(nx.adjacency_matrix(G))      ```  outputs are here ``` [[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]                                                                                                                                                                         [1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]                                                                                                                                                                         [1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]                                                                                                                                                                         [0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]                                                                                                                                                                         [0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]                                                                                                                                                                         [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.]                                                                                                                                                                         [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1.]                                                                                                                                                                         [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]]                                                                                                                                                                          (0, 1)    1                                                                                                                                                                                       (0, 2)    1  <= ?
