Weighing in here from the [PyWhy](https://github.com/py-why) community where we work with causal graphs and define Python protocols for those graphs to allow users to come with their own graph implementations (in case they don't use NetworkX). See [here](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy/blob/ead8d47102f0ac6db51d84432874c331fb84f3cb/dowhy/gcm/graph.py#L23-L53) and [here](https://github.com/py-why/dodiscover/blob/3c4f8d251dcf080c4bce83292affff6cd46f335d/dodiscover/_protocol.py#L6-L44).  We'd also love to see inline annotations implemented in NetworkX as this PR suggests. We believe it makes the code easier to understand and it would help implementers of our protocol classes understand what the expected return types are. Right now, we had to put the types into the docstrings, otherwise the IDE complains that a `networkx.DiGraph` does not implement `dowhy.gcm.graph.DirectedGraph` even though it does.
