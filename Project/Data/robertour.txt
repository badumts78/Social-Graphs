Time complexity in method documentation#TITLE_END#I am  working with a computer simulation and constantly trying to optimize parts of code that runs multiple times. It would be great if there is a note in the documentation indicating the time complexity of, at least, the basic methods. For example, I had previously assumed ***constant (O(1))*** times for the [nodes()](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.Graph.nodes.html) and [neigbors()](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.Graph.neighbors.html) in the Graph class, but it is actually linear (O(N))  I understand that it could be difficult for some complicated algorithms, and the big O is not always a good criteria, but I think it would be useful to point out the complexity of the basic methods (or an approximate). Ideally, point out to alternatives, e.g. it is possible to use self.g.adj[n1]  (O(1)) instead of neighbors() (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2438) (O(N)) 
issue
Random access to node neighbors#TITLE_END#At least, in network simulations is common to have  to randomly select a node out of the possible neighbors:  For example, select two nodes that are going two perform an interaction. I have to do this.      for id1, n1 in self.g.nodes_iter(data=True):         n2 = self.g.node[random.choice(self.g.neighbors(id1))]  However as far I can read from the code, `neighbors()` is generated from `self.g.adj` so it has an O(n) time. Ideally we would have random access, i.e. O(k) time.   One posibility would be to keep a separated list of node indexes, or to use a random access dictionary such as this: https://github.com/robtandy/randomdict  Would this improvement makes sense at all? I understand that most of the time nodes have very few neighbors, but at the same time in simulations the g.neighbors(id1) is accessed constantly.   (Obviously I can keep the list of neighbors as an attribute myself, but I am just posting because I think that it is an important issue that should be at least discussed)
