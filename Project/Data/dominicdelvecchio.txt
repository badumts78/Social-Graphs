node_disjoint_path Different results on different machines#TITLE_END#I'm not sure if this is an issue so much as differences between machines. I am finding when I use node_disjoint_path across different machines the number of independent paths returned is the same, but the paths themselves are different. All on windows dell machines. One laptop reliably returns the same paths. Another desktop reliably returns the same paths but different form the other laptop. The other laptop seems to return different paths each run(although we are in the process of verifying that now).  Would you shed some light on why the function behaves this way across machines? Thank you Dominic  **edit  So it appears the issue is not across different machines, but the restarting of the python kernel.
