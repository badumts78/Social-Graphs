Reverse breaks DiGraphs with default-hashed objects#TITLE_END#The NetworkX documentation [states that graph nodes can be any hashable object](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/introduction.html#networkx-basics), and the glossary [defines hashable](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/glossary.html#term-hashable) per the Python definition (that is, implements `__hash__` and a comparison method). It goes out of its way to state that instances of user-defined classes are hashable (and unique) by default:  > All of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable, while no mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are. **Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their id().**  That would seem to suggest that NetworkX supports graphs made of default-hashed objects (and nodes are considered the same if they're reference-equal). However, I found that the `reverse` method doesn't respect this property. Example:  ```python import networkx as nx  class Unique(object):     pass  u = Unique()  g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_edge("A", u) assert "A" in g assert u in g # passes g.nodes() # ['A', <__main__.Unique object at 0x102e0fe10>] g.edges() # [('A', <__main__.Unique object at 0x102e0fe10>)]  rev = g.reverse() assert "A" in rev assert u in rev # fails ಠ_ಠ rev.nodes() # ['A', <__main__.Unique object at 0x102e0fd10>] rev.edges() # [(<__main__.Unique object at 0x102e0fe10>, 'A')] # Unique address is different in nodes() and edges(): `fd10` vs `fe10` ಠ_ಠ ```  What seems to happen is that `reverse` "deep copies" the graph (this is where it calls `Unique.__new__`, at least), and then seemingly doesn't keep track of objects that it has already copied.
