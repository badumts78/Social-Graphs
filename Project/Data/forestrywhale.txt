So I have this similar problem.   ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> I'm using python 3.7.7, an environment created with conda.  I can successfully install the networkx package with no problem, but using `import networkx as nx` failed.   The error msg is as following: ``` --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-1-d74fe3806494> in <module>       1 import scipy.sparse.csgraph as sgh ----> 2 import networkx as nx  ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/__init__.py in <module>      59 from networkx.relabel import *      60  ---> 61 import networkx.generators      62 from networkx.generators import *      63   ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/generators/__init__.py in <module>      14 from networkx.generators.geometric import *      15 from networkx.generators.internet_as_graphs import * ---> 16 from networkx.generators.intersection import *      17 from networkx.generators.interval_graph import *      18 from networkx.generators.joint_degree_seq import *  ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/generators/intersection.py in <module>       3 """       4 import networkx as nx ----> 5 from networkx.algorithms import bipartite       6 from networkx.utils import py_random_state       7   ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/__init__.py in <module>      77 import networkx.algorithms.tournament      78 import networkx.algorithms.traversal ---> 79 import networkx.algorithms.tree      80       81 # Make certain functions from some of the previous subpackages available  ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/tree/__init__.py in <module>       4 from .recognition import *       5 from .operations import * ----> 6 from .decomposition import *  ~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/tree/decomposition.py in <module>       3 import networkx as nx       4 from networkx.utils import not_implemented_for ----> 5 from networkx.algorithms import moral, complete_to_chordal_graph, chordal_graph_cliques       6 from itertools import combinations       7   ImportError: cannot import name 'complete_to_chordal_graph' from 'networkx.algorithms' (/Users/huijing/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/__init__.py) ```

I have also tried to uninstall and reinstall with `pip` but no luck.

Okay, so I was using Jupyter notebook when encountering the problem. So I stopped the jupyter notebook in the terminal, then uninstall and reinstall with `pip`, the error is gone :)

> It looks like you all are using conda: maybe this is a conda install and/or environment management issue? You can try the following to see if there's a problem installing networkx from conda in a fresh conda environment: >  > ``` > conda create -n nx-testenv python=3.7 > conda activate nx-testenv > conda install networkx > python -c "import networkx; print(networkx.__version__)" > ``` >  > Please report if you have problems with the above.  Thank you! I tried that with no problem. Actually, I think mine is due to package confliction. I specifically asked conda to install the 2.5 version of networkx, and then found that I have an old cameo package that asks networkx 1.9.1. Once I uninstall the cameo and reinstall the 2.5 version, everything worked out.
