`compute_v_structures` output and docstring do not agree#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior The docstring of the method `compute_v_structures` in `dag.py` says  > Iterate through the graph to compute all v-structures. >  >     V-structures are triples in the directed graph where >     two parent nodes point to the same child and the two parent nodes >     are not adjacent. > ...  In particular, the part **_and the two parent nodes are not adjacent_** is what seems to disagree with the output of the iterator for a DAG. To my knowledge, in a DAG `G=(V, E)` two nodes `a,b` are adjacent if `(a,b) in E || (b,a) in E`:  ``` In [6]: import networkx as nx  In [7]: G = nx.DiGraph()    ...: G.add_edges_from([(2, 4), (5, 4), (2, 5)])    ...: list(nx.compute_v_structures(G)) Out[7]: [(2, 4, 5)]  In [8]: list(G.adjacency()) Out[8]: [(2, {4: {}, 5: {}}), (4, {}), (5, {4: {}})] ```  Clearly, 2 and 5 are adjacent, yet the function still returns (2,4,5) as a v-structure.  ### Expected Behavior  The test case above should return an empty list or the docstring should change its specification of v-structures.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Install `networkx >= 3.1` and run the above commands.  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.8 - 3.11 NetworkX version: 3.1 - 3.21
