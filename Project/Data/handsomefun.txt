issue
duplicated node in one connected component#TITLE_END#`                 g = nx.Graph()        for (a, b) in pairs:             g.add_edge(a, b)        for community in nx.connected_components(g):              print '%s' % (','.join([str(node) for node in community])) ` I have used the code above to build a graph with nodes more than 1 million , Then generate 160000 connected components.  But I found there are  many node belong to  two components(i think they should be merged), and one node appears in one component twice.  I want to know is it an issue, or i have some misunderstandings about graph or connected components.
