contracted graphs cannot be converted to `pydot`#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior  Contracted graphs cannot be converted/exported to `pydot`. They have unquoted values in the 'contraction' attribute.  ### Steps to Reproduce  ```python import networkx as nx ```   ```python >>> G: nx.DiGraph = nx.DiGraph() >>> G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2)]) >>>  >>> from networkx.algorithms.minors.contraction import contracted_nodes >>>  >>> H = contracted_nodes(G, 0, 2) >>>  >>> print(H.nodes().data()) >>> print(H.edges().data())  [(0, {'contraction': {2: {}}}), (1, {})] [(0, 1, {}), (1, 0, {})] ```      ```python >>> try: >>>     graph = nx.nx_pydot.to_pydot(H) >>> except ValueError as e: >>>     print(e)  ValueError: Node names and attributes should not contain ":" unless they are quoted with "". For example the string 'attribute:data1' should be written as '"attribute:data1"'.                 Please refer https://github.com/pydot/pydot/issues/258 ```  **Workaround:** remove "contraction" attribute from nodes and edges.  ```python >>> for n, d in H.nodes().data(): >>>     d.pop("contraction", None) >>> for n1, n2, d in H.edges().data(): >>>     d.pop("contraction", None) >>> print(H.nodes().data()) >>> print(H.edges().data())  [(0, {}), (1, {})] [(0, 1, {}), (1, 0, {})] ```       ```python >>> graph = nx.nx_pydot.to_pydot(H) >>> print(graph.create_dot().decode('utf-8'))  strict digraph {     graph [bb="0,0,54,108"];     node [label="\N"];     0     [height=0.5,         pos="27,90",         width=0.75];     1     [height=0.5,         pos="27,18",         width=0.75];     0 -> 1     [pos="e,21.121,35.956 21.16,72.411 20.297,64.507 20.048,54.852 20.412,45.935"];     1 -> 0     [pos="e,32.84,72.411 32.879,35.956 33.714,43.827 33.948,53.374 33.583,62.187"]; } ``` ### Environment  Python version: 3.9 NetworkX version: 2.8.8
