Since in my user case I only get the LCA once before modifying the graph, the code will look something like:  > > > from networkx.algorithms.lowest_common_ancestor import all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor as LCA > > > node_pair = [left_node, right_node] > > > _, lca = LCA(G, pairs=node_pair)[0] 1. So an alias might be a good idea.    all_plairs… → LCA    tree_all_pairs… → t_LCA 2. If not, no problem, I wil do a helper on my program 3. the itertools.product is finally not used 4. there are a couple trailing whitespaces that need not to be there  (you may want to configure your editor to alert these kind of things)
