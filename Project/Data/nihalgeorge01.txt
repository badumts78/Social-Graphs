Fix rich_club_coefficient() for single node and empty graphs#TITLE_END#<!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code. For more details check out step 1 and 4 of https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html --> Partial fix for issue #6920 rich_club_coefficient() bugs  For the empty graph, degree_histogram() errors out when using max() on an empty collections.Counter. This is fixed by explicitly checking the condition of non-empty counter  For the single node graph, _compute_rc() errors out where edge_degrees is popped just before the for loop. This assumes that there is at least 1 edge in the graph. For edgeless graphs, rich club coefficient dictionary should probably be empty since it is defined only for non-negative degree values d where there exist at least 2 nodes of degree > d. In an edgeless graph, there are no such nodes for any non-negative d. This is fixed by explicitly checking the edge count before the pop

Fix random_spanning_tree() for single node and empty graphs#TITLE_END#<!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code. For more details check out step 1 and 4 of https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html --> Partial fix for issue #6920 for random_spanning_tree() by checking explicitly for empty and single node graphs. Earlier, the main for loop was the only return path, and these edge cases would cause an Exception meant for trees with less edges.
