OS dependent failure when networkx is imported (multiprocessing fork issue)#TITLE_END#Hi all  First off, thanks for the really awesome package!  I debugged the whole day until I was able to reduce it to this minimal failing example. There are multiple modules at play, but I post it here first, since networkx is the only non-standard one. But it might very well be that the error is caused by one of the other modules, or me missing some fineprint on potential limits. The only think I do with networkx is import it.  ``` python import asyncio import sqlite3 import multiprocessing  # FIX1: remove networx import import networkx  def does_not_work():     filename = 'temp.txt'     dbname = ':memory:' # same issue for file     # FIX2: locally import again (we are in a Process, see below)     # import sqlite3      with open(filename, 'w') as f:         f.write('bla')      # FIX3: open the file for no reason     # with open(filename, 'w') as f:     #     pass      print('last working statement')     with sqlite3.connect(dbname, timeout=0):         print('connected!')     print('success!')  if __name__ == '__main__':     # we create a server     loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()     server_coro = loop.create_server(lambda: asyncio.Protocol(),                                     'localhost', 24000)     server = loop.run_until_complete(server_coro)      # and launch a function (not related to server in any way) in a Process     p = multiprocessing.Process(target=does_not_work)     p.start()     p.join() ```  On my OSX, I only see: ``` last working statement ``` the Process p just seems to die silently when trying to connect to the database.  If you remove any of the nexworkx import, the server, the process, the file-write or database connect, all works out. ``` last working statement connected! success! ```  There are two strange ways to fix it as well, with networkx in play, see FIX2&3.  I tested networkx==2.1 and 2.2, as well as python 3.5.5, 3.6.6 and 3.7.0 always in a fresh venv. Pip freeze for one setting yields: ``` decorator==4.3.0 networkx==2.2 ```  My friend with a Ubuntu does not have this issue, hence my relevant OS information below: ``` macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6 (17G65) Python 3.6.6 (default, Aug 15 2018, 00:30:57) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2)] on darwin ``` Is networkx or it's dependencies doing something different for OSX? Or am I already way in undefined behavior land?
