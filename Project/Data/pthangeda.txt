Eulerization of Graphs - Enhancement#TITLE_END#As mentioned in #2869 Eulerization of a graph is essential for many applications. While #3076 implemented a function for Eulerizing graph, it is limited to undirected graphs and is also restricted to using the path length as the cost that is minimized during Eulerization.   I've implemented Eulerization scheme that works for directed graphs and also lets the user pick the attribute he wants to use as the weight that he wants to minimize during Eulerization of the graph. I will have the PR ready in a few days - seeking comments from others before I go ahead and do a PR.
