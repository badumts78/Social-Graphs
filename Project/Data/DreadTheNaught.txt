Added match statements to shortest_path function#TITLE_END#As stated in issue [#7036](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7036), there is a need to add python features from 3.10 now that 3.9 support has dropped. This PR switches out all the if else statements from the shortest_path function to match-case statements. This can be done for more than just this function, I've just started with this.
