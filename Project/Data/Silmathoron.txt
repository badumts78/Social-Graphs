degree_assortativity_coefficient not working with non-integer weights#TITLE_END#Hi there, it seems that ``degree_assortativity_coefficient`` does not work with non-integer edge weights, yet this requirement is not mentioned [in the doc](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.assortativity.degree_assortativity_coefficient.html#networkx.algorithms.assortativity.degree_assortativity_coefficient) and seems strange to me.      nx.degree_assortativity_coefficient(g, x="in", y="in", weight="float_weights")  leads to      Traceback (most recent call last):       File "script.py", line 131, in <module>         nx.degree_assortativity_coefficient(g, x="in", y="in", weight="float_weights")       File "/path/to/lib/python3.8/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/assortativity/correlation.py", line 77, in degree_assortativity_coefficient         M = degree_mixing_matrix(G, x=x, y=y, nodes=nodes, weight=weight)       File "/path/to/lib/python3.8/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/assortativity/mixing.py", line 160, in degree_mixing_matrix         mapping = {x: x for x in range(m + 1)}     TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer  with Python 3.8, using networkx 2.4.  Is this a bug or is it supposed to be only for integers?  If I am not mistaken, changing the weights by an arbitrary factor should make no difference to the final result (apart from tiny floating point roundings) so one could probably almost always work on digitized versions of the weights. In that case, would it be possible to easily adapt the algorithm to arbitrary weights?  EDIT: to clarify, I could obviously update the weights myself, but that would be fairly slow so my question is more "is it possible to do this somewhere in the algorithm to make this fast and avoid the creation of a new edge attribute?"
issue
Updated draw_networkx to accept numpy array for edgelist#TITLE_END#Fixes #4129  Small update to ``draw_networkx`` to work with latest numpy versions when a numpy array is provided for ``edgelist``. Added associated test.
issue
edgelist in draw_network does not support arrays#TITLE_END#Using numpy 1.18.2 and networkx 2.4, it is not possible to use a numpy array for the `edgelist` argument of [``draw_networkx``](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx.html). It raises: ``` ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all() ```  I normally would not have opened an issue for that but I do not see the point of the current implementation, so in case it can be changed harmlessly to support numpy arrays, that might be a win-win.  The issue comes from lines 575-579 on 2.4 ([lines 640-647](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L640) on master) that read:  ```python     if edgelist is None:         edgelist = list(G.edges())      if not edgelist or len(edgelist) == 0:  # no edges!         return None ```  I am not sure what the combination of ``not edgelist`` and ``len(edgelist) == 0`` is for, here, so I would propose to change it to  ```python     if edgelist is None:         edgelist = list(G.edges())     elif len(edgelist) == 0:  # no edges!         return None ```  which should still do the job for all valid inputs I can think of and would also work with numpy arrays.  **EDIT** if iterables should be supported, one could replace ``not edgelist`` by ``not isinstance(edgelist, Iterable)``
