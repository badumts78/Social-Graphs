Generalized network simplex#TITLE_END#This is a draft PR to implement the Generalized Network Simplex algorithm.  The purpose is to make it easier to search from networkx PRs tab, when people needs to implement something similar in future.  There is 2 test examples [here](https://github.com/alexandremcosta/networkx/blob/1f4660e317692ec7f7b3037c890aeb10b2837ba9/networkx/algorithms/flow/tests/test_generalizedflow.py) and [here](https://github.com/alexandremcosta/networkx/blob/1f4660e317692ec7f7b3037c890aeb10b2837ba9/networkx/algorithms/flow/teste_generalized_01.py). There can be bugs, so do not use it in production without previously testing.  The code was implemented as part of the Master program of PUC-Rio, for the Combinatorial Optimization credits, under supervision of professor [Marcus Poggi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-poggi-267509132/).  The implementation was heavily inspired on: `Ahuja, R. K.; Magnanti, T. L. & Orlin, J. B. (1993), Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications , Prentice hall`
