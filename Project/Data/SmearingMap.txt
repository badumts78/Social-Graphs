Added function to eulerize simple graphs to algorithms.euler#TITLE_END#As discussed in [issue 2869](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2869), I have implemented a function to transform a graph into an Eulerian graph along the lines mentioned in [these lecture notes](http://www.math.unl.edu/%7Ebharbourne1/M203Spr07/EulerizationHandout.pdf) and using the method described [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/9126/is-there-a-non-brute-force-algorithm-for-eulerization-of-graphs) to find an efficient set of paths.  I have also written test cases for Eulerization of Erdos-Renyi graphs and some complete graphs.  I am labeling this as a WIP because this would be my first commit to NetworkX and expect that there may be things I haven't thought of or things I have done wrong.  I have also not implemented this for directed graphs.  This is because I use `nx.max_weight_matching` to find an Eulerization that doesn't require duplicated too many edges.  I am sure directed graphs can be Eulerized, but I can't see how to do this efficiently.

from_numpy_matrix creates edges with numpy datatypes #TITLE_END#The function `from_numpy_matrix` creates graphs where some nodes in the edge tuples have numpy datatypes.      >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)     >>> A = nx.adj_matrix(G).todense()     >>> H = nx.from_numpy_matrix(A)     >>> [(type(x), type(y)) for x, y in H.edges()]     [(<class 'int'>, <class 'numpy.int64'>), (<class 'int'>, <class 'numpy.int64'>), (<class 'int'>, <class 'numpy.int64'>), (<class 'int'>, <class 'numpy.int64'>)]  This can cause problems when trying to serialize a graph.  For example:      >>> import json     >>> json.dumps(nx.json_graph.node_link_data(H))     TypeError: Object of type 'int64' is not JSON serializable

Numpy matrix edge fix issue 3086#TITLE_END#I believe this fixes the problem I brought up in [issue 3086](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3086).
comment
I am willing to work on this.  This would be my first PR for NetworkX and only my second on Github, so I may need a bit of guidance.  Three questions:  1. Should the graph be Eulerized in place by default? 2. Does it make sense to Eulerize weighted graphs?  I can think of a few reasonable ways one might re-assign weights to new edges, but nothing unique.  Should the function throw an exception or raise a warning if the edges are weighted? 3. Where should I look to get a sense of what tests I should write for the function and where should the tests go?

That's very helpful.  I have started working on this.
