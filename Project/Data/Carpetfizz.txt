Possible typo on min_weighted_dominating_set documentation#TITLE_END#[Click here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.approximation.dominating_set.min_weighted_dominating_set.html#networkx.algorithms.approximation.dominating_set.min_weighted_dominating_set) for the function in question.  I believe the section  > weight (string) – The node attribute storing the weight of an **edge**. If provided, the node attribute with this key must be a number for each node. If not provided, each node is assumed to have weight one.  should read  > weight (string) – The node attribute storing the weight of **a node**. If provided, the node attribute with this key must be a number for each node. If not provided, each node is assumed to have weight one.
