hello! here I need some help:  file from this link [https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//auto_examples/drawing/plot_knuth_miles.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-drawing-plot-knuth-miles-py](url)  is not readable: ``` fh = gzip.open("knuth_miles.txt.gz", "r")   for line in fh.readlines():       break ```  ` OSError: Not a gzipped file (b'\n\n') `  can you let me know where could I find the right file?
