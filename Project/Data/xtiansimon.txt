issue
G.predecessors(node) documentation could benefit from additional explanation#TITLE_END#I'm on a _tree_ network similar to this toy,      [('total_fruits', 'apples'),      ('total_fruits_and_vegetables', 'total_fruits'),      ('total_fruits_and_vegetables', 'total_vegetables'),      ('total_vegetables', 'carrot')]  To find the root node I'm using this solution on StackOverflow: [NetworkX find root_node for a particular node in a directed graph](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47191030/343215). This solution works, but I think the documentation could be clearer.   The documentation for predecessor [networkx.DiGraph.predecessors](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.DiGraph.predecessors.html) says:   > DiGraph.predecessors(n)[source] > Return an iterator over predecessor nodes of n.  For my tree I expected G.predecessors(node) output to return _all_ of the predecessors to the root,      [n for n in G.predecessors('apples')]     >>> ['apples', ''total_fruits', 'total_fruits_and_vegetables']  But what I get:      [n for n in G.predecessors('apples')]     >>>['total_fruits']  Finally, I realized _nodes_ refers to the predecessors one level or edge from the node parameter, because the network may not be a tree.   In this edge case I'm asking if maybe the documentation could benefit further description.
