issue
Calculating hitting time, commute time : NetworkX snippet#TITLE_END#``` def findBoundedHittingTime(G, node1, node2, limit):     currentnode = node1     steps = 0      while(currentnode != node2) :         if(steps > limit):             return -1         currentnode = random.choice(list(G[currentnode].keys()))         steps = steps + 1      return steps ```  I performed the random walk to find the hitting time as shown in the snippet above.  But looks like the hitting time is actually defined as the _expected_ number of steps from nodeA to nodeB  and is calculated using probability distribution/linear algebra/laplacian (_[1]_). Is there a snippet already available which does the same.. Please let me know and correct me if I'm wrong anywhere.   Thanks in advance!
