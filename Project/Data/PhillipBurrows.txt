issue
Using networkx in Azure Databrick results in extremely slow writing to blob storage#TITLE_END#I have developed a routing process for research on transportation network disruption events. The script runs well apart from writing the results df to Azure blob storage (as csv) extremely slowly. It's a small results file (3.8mb) of a pyspark dataframe takes over 3 hours to write. It would seem to me that the bug is somehow coming from having used nx functions on the df. The same file can be read, written and reread from blob storage very quickly in a notebook where nx is installed, but wasn't used on the df. Other applications in our department that use databricks (without networkx functions) have not experienced this slowdown issue.   Is there any way implementing this package could result in extremely slow file writing? Has anyone else here deployed networkx tools in Azure Databricks/Azure storage explorer?
