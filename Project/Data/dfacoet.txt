Parameter off by one in dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  The parameter `n` of `dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph` is off by one. According to the docs and the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0112143),   > for a given n: - Total number of nodes = 3 * (3**n + 1) / 2 - Total number of edges = 3 ** (n + 1)  However that's not the case, e.g.  ```python [len(nx.dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph(i).nodes) for i in range(4)] # Output: [2, 3, 6, 15]  [len(nx.dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph(i).edges) for i in range(4)] # Output: [1, 3, 9, 27] ``` instead of [3, 6, 15, 42] and [3, 9, 27, 81] respectively.  ### Expected Behavior  `dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph(n)` should return what is currently returned by `dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph(n+1)`, as claimed in the docs. `n=-1` should be a valid value (as in the paper).   ```python [len(nx.dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph(i).nodes) for i in range(4)] # Output: [3, 6, 15, 42]   ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.12 NetworkX version: 3.3
