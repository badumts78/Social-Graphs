Personalization in PageRank#TITLE_END#In https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/pagerank_alg.py in all algorithms, the personalization dict accepted needs a value for every node. In my personal application, most values are 0. I suspect that in a lot of applications, including the default, most nodes will have the same probability. Furthermore, for all but the PageRank algorithm, the docstring suggests that each of these values needs to be non-zero. As far as I know, there is no code-technical or mathematical basis for this and it should be "at least one non-zero value".  My proposal:  - Add a parameter specifying a default value for personalization. - Do not force presence of all keys in personalization, instead use default value for non-existant values. - Rewrite docstrings to specify "at least one non-zero value"  I'll be happy to implement this. Feedback appreciated. :)

Making in_edges equivalent to out_edges#TITLE_END#Fixes #2205 
issue
Retrieving edge data in directed graphs has an asymmetric API#TITLE_END#[DiGraph.out_edges](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/networkx.DiGraph.out_edges.html) has the useful feature that you can retrieve a single value from the data dictionary by specifiying a string.  [DiGraph.in_edges](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/networkx.DiGraph.in_edges.html), [MultiDiGraph.out_edges](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/networkx.MultiDiGraph.out_edges.html) and [MultiDiGraph.in_edges](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/networkx.MultiDiGraph.in_edges.html) lack this.   I'll likely prepare a PR for this myself, but I wanted to make this issue first, in case I missed something or anyone has useful information in relation to this.
