WIP: layered layout drawing algorithm#TITLE_END#This is still work in progress, but working to the point where I'd like NetworkX community's reviews.  I want to focus on solving glitches for some edge cases (edges drawn awkward when they could be straight, too big spacing between groups of nodes...). If someone has time, notably to fix the display of long edges (see below), I'd be glad :)  * Is anyone knowledgeable on `FancyArrowPatch`? Using `path` parameter hides the arrow for long edges, probably because `FancyArrowPatch` discards `shrinkA` and `shrinkB` parameters when `path` is given. See `ny_pylab.py:794`. * `import numpy as np` appeared 17 times in `layout.py`. I made it a global import in this file. * Why keep the `dim` parameter when most layouts don't support `dim != 2`? A lot of layout functions do that. * Tests still need to be written.   Hail NetworkX! :D
