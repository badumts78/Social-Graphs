Bug in networkx.algorithms.lowest_common_ancestor()#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  First, I create an graph(a tree actually): ```python >>> import networkx as nx >>> g = nx.DiGraph() >>> g.add_nodes_from([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]) >>> g.add_edges_from([(2,0), (1,2), (3,2),(5,2),(8,2),(11,2),(4,5),(6,5),(7,8),(10,8),(13,11),(14,11),(15,11),(9,10),(12,13),(16,15)])  ``` Here is an visualization of the graph: ![c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34032031/105974095-7fdf5300-60c8-11eb-9c36-82ae79842215.png)  I want to find the lowest common ancestor between node `7` and `9`:  ```python >>> anc = nx.algorithms.lowest_common_ancestor(g, 7, 9) >>> anc ```  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  anc is None! ```python >>> print(anc is None) True >>>  ```  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  anc should be node `8`!  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ```python >>> import networkx as nx >>> g = nx.DiGraph() >>> g.add_nodes_from([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]) >>> g.add_edges_from([(2,0), (1,2), (3,2),(5,2),(8,2),(11,2),(4,5),(6,5),(7,8),(10,8),(13,11),(14,11),(15,11),(9,10),(12,13),(16,15)]) >>> anc = nx.algorithms.lowest_common_ancestor(g, 7, 9) >>> anc >>> nx.nx_agraph.write_dot(g, '/tmp/c.dot') >>> print(anc is None) True ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.6.12 NetworkX version: 2.5   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
