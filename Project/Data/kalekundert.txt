`nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes()` doesn't return initial node label hashes#TITLE_END#The documentation for [`nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.graph_hashing.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes.html) says:  > Return a dictionary of subgraph hashes by node. > > Dictionary keys are nodes in G, and values are a list of hashes. [...] Thus, each list will contain `iterations + 1` elements - a hash for a subgraph at each depth, and additionally a hash of the initial node label (or equivalently a subgraph of depth 0).  However, this does not seem to be true.  Instead, each list contains exactly `iterations` elements: ``` $ python Python 3.10.0 (default, Oct 20 2021, 17:23:57) [Clang 12.0.1 ] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import networkx as nx >>> nx.__version__ '3.2.1' >>> g = nx.Graph() >>> g.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5)]) >>> from pprint import pprint >>> pprint(nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes(g, iterations=0)) {} >>> pprint(nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes(g, iterations=1)) {1: ['68f978fe50aca8ee91e0e1f94618c62f'],  2: ['894dc79574bde41801cac14fd57ec400'],  3: ['10389b57da35bacfdc13c9e30e9e570c'],  4: ['b116fb80ba37be518541699f88f59552'],  5: ['b116fb80ba37be518541699f88f59552']} >>> pprint(nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes(g, iterations=2)) {1: ['68f978fe50aca8ee91e0e1f94618c62f', 'b3496d57ca1431116b6fadf050fda2d1'],  2: ['894dc79574bde41801cac14fd57ec400', '1f530b281c4a6431be460f9c2cf3a3c8'],  3: ['10389b57da35bacfdc13c9e30e9e570c', '8bd35db2b7b7d8b6a58d02ac65484155'],  4: ['b116fb80ba37be518541699f88f59552', '44d3ad5fc8deaed080025e1e66bceebb'],  5: ['b116fb80ba37be518541699f88f59552', '44d3ad5fc8deaed080025e1e66bceebb']} ``` It seems that the "hash of the initial node label" is not actually included in the output.  In the above example, nodes 1, 4, and 5 should have the same initial hash, because they are all order 1.  But you can see that their hashes always differ.  Here's the relevant code:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/00e3c4c4ecad08bff17b894f6d39bcc96a3c583f/networkx/algorithms/graph_hashing.py#L301-L309  `node_labels` contains the initial hashes, but it never gets incorporated into `node_subgraph_hashes`.  Perhaps line 303 should instead be: `node_subgraph_hashes = {k: [v] for k, v in node_labels.items()}`.  That said, I'm not really sure if this is an actual bug, or just a documentation bug.  For what it's worth, I think documented behavior is what *should* happen, but I don't really know a lot about this algorithm.  I didn't make a PR because I don't know if the code or the docs should be fixed, but if someone makes a decision about that, I'd be happy to make a PR.

The changes relating to #7330 look good to me.  Thanks for getting to this so quickly!
