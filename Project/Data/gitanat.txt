issue
bfs_edges, dfs_edges don't return cycles#TITLE_END#I'm not sure if this is a feature of a bug, but networkx.traversal.bfs/dfs_edges don't return edges whose end is a already-processed node (forming a cycle). While it would make no sense for DFS/BFS to process a _node_ twice, I can't see a reason why _the edges_ are not returned.  If this is intended behaviour, maybe the method description should be changed? `Produces edges in a breadth-first-search starting at source` seems to imply that it returns _all_ graph edges  Example 1:  ``` g=nx.Graph() g.add_edge(1,1) print list(nx.traversal.bfs_edges(g,1)) ```  this prints `[]`, I expected `[(1,1)]`  Example 2:  ``` g=nx.Graph() g.add_edge(1,2) g.add_edge(2,3) g.add_edge(3,1) ```  This returns `[(1,2),(1,3)]`. Expected:  `[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)]` 
issue
algorithms.components.connected_component_subgraphs fails on un(deep)copyable objects#TITLE_END#Minimal steps to reproduce:  ``` import re import networkx as nx g=nx.Graph() g.add_edge(1,2,re.compile("")) s= nx.components.connected_component_subgraphs(g) ```  raises `TypeError` or similar for un(deep)copyable objects.  The change was introduced in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/ae5f3e6df0d36aafe62201dfd8cbc0548d837c15  Can an option be added for doing this without deepcopying? Or a fallback?
