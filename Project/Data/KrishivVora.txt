Converting from DOT graph file to NetworkX graph adds unexpected '\\n' node#TITLE_END#Converting from a DOT graph file to a NetworkX graph using the function G = nx.Graph(nx.nx_pydot.read_dot(path)) (as mentioned on https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pydot.read_dot.html) adds an unexpected and inexplicable '\\n' node to the NetworkX graph that is not present in the Graphviz DOT graph.  ### Current Behavior NetworkX graph has an extra '\\\n' node that shouldn't be there.  ### Expected Behavior NetworkX graph has exactly the same nodes as the DOT graph file indicates.  ### Steps to Reproduce Create a simple DOT graph file and convert it to NetworkX using G = nx.Graph(nx.nx_pydot.read_dot(path)), then show nodes using nx.nodes(G).  ### Environment Python version: 3.9.12 NetworkX version: 2.7.1
