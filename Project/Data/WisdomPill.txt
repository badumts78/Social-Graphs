issue
Bad practice for ensuring only python3.5 and up#TITLE_END#In setup.py there's the check that python version should be equal or higher than python3.5,  but the python_requires in the setup method should take care of it, using this  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/98e0a6ebd25a0183b6a0f6375cccaf5619209b59/setup.py#L22  breaks dependencies such as scikit-image for people using python3.5 and lower. Like I said in scikit-image/scikit-image#4094  python_requires should be used like it says here https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers  Can I make a PR for fixing this?
