issue
all_node_cuts returns too few and incorrect cuts.#TITLE_END#This could be a documentation issue, a bug or a user understanding issue. Are these cases pathological for the algorithm?  Given a square graph:  ```  a -- b  |    |  c -- d ```  Based on a cursory reading of the documentation, I would have expected all_node_cuts() to return:  ``` [{'a','d'}, {'c','b'}] ```  I get `[{'a','c'}]` but if this is a valid node cut then surely {a,b}, {b,d}, {c,d} are also equally valid and a function called "all node cuts" should return them.   ``` G = nx.Graph([('a','b'), ('a','c'), ('c','d'), ('b','d')]) print( G.nodes() ) print( G.edges() ) print( list(nx.all_node_cuts(G)) )  >>> ['a', 'c', 'b', 'd'] >>> [('a', 'c'), ('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd'), ('b', 'd')] >>> [{'a', 'c'}] ```  Expanding to a hexagon, we see similar pattern of node cuts. There are many isometric node cuts omitted from the results list. Two of the proposed cuts fail to create "two or more connected components" as the documentation suggests.  ``` G = nx.Graph([('a','b'), ('b','c'), ('c','d'),('d','e'), ('e','f'),('f','a')]) list(nx.all_node_cuts(G)) >>> [{'a', 'c'}, {'a', 'b'}, {'b', 'c'}] ```
