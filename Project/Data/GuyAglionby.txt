Kou et al. Steiner tree approximation inefficiency#TITLE_END#The existing Steiner tree approximation algorithm (from Kou et al.) finds the metric closure of the whole graph `G`, which requires finding all-pairs shortest paths. However, all that is actually needed are the shortest paths between terminal nodes. For even moderately sized graphs, and in cases where there are few terminal nodes relative to total nodes, this therefore unnecessarily increases runtime.   A solution could be to use `single_source_dijkstra` with a `source` and `target` for each pair, noting that we're restricted to undirected graphs so can avoid doubling up. It would be nice if we could supply multiple targets to this function to avoid throwing away work, but I can't see a function that lets us do this. In any case simply replacing with multiple calls to this method will improve things (see implementation of method that is currently used `all_pairs_dijkstra`).

Add Mehlhorn Steiner approximations#TITLE_END#Re discussion #5352   This PR adds two new approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problem: one from Wu et al. (1986), and another from Mehlhorn (1988). Both are asymptotically faster than the existing approximation from Kou et al. (1981).  One thing I haven't done is change the default algorithm from Kou's, although I think this would be desirable. I suggest setting Wu's as the default, as although the worst-case runtime is slower than Mehlhorn's, in practice I've found it to be faster. This is probably down to Mehlhorn requiring in all cases the shortest paths from all terminal nodes to all other nodes to be calculated; this is not the case with Wu's algorithm.  Any comments and feedback appreciated.
