Issue with matrix market read functionality from NetworkX documentation#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  When following a similar format as presented [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/matrix_market.html), my code returns an error message stating:  ``` TypeError: 'coo_matrix' object is not subscriptable ```  ### Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  The code above should create a graph H from the matrix market file.   ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> The way I am reading my file is as follows: ```python with open(filename, "rb") as fh:     buf = io.BytesIO(fh.read()) buf.seek(0) H = nx.from_numpy_array(sp.io.mmread(buf)) print("H =", H) ```  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 3.0 SciPy version: 1.10.0  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> None.

Unable to Iterate over Iterator returned by bfs_edges#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> I am attempting to compare a self-developed BFS algorithm to ensure correctness against the NetworkX bfs_edges function to compare the depth array. Using the online tutorial I am attempting to get the node depths through this method:  `nodes = [root] + [v for u, v in resnx]` As described on the documentation, but it returns an error saying that my root node was not found in the graph. I then attempted to just convert the returned iterator into a list, but that also returned the same error. I was hoping to figure out what I am doing wrong. Thank you!  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> An error is returned saying that a particular node is not in a graph when attempting to convert the iterator returned by bfs_edges to a list.  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> The error should not occur, since the node is in fact in the graph.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> The example link [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.traversal.breadth_first_search.bfs_edges.html#networkx.algorithms.traversal.breadth_first_search.bfs_edges). Instead of creating a graph, I am reading one in from an edgelist. I am using the Delaunay_n10 benchmark graph. My code is here:   ``` G = nx.read_edgelist("delaunay_n10.gr") root = int((totalV-1)/2) resnx = nx.bfs_edges(G, root) nodes = [root] + [v for u, v in resnx] ```  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9.1 NetworkX version: 2.5  ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> Error message: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/rhome/oaa9/anaconda3/envs/arkouda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py", line 1238, in neighbors     return iter(self._adj[n]) KeyError: 511  The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/rhome/oaa9/ArkoudaExtension/testingFiles/bfs.py", line 69, in <module>     time_ak_bfs_delaunay_graph(i)   File "/rhome/oaa9/ArkoudaExtension/testingFiles/bfs.py", line 52, in time_ak_bfs_delaunay_graph     nodes = [root] + [v for u, v in resnx]   File "/rhome/oaa9/ArkoudaExtension/testingFiles/bfs.py", line 52, in <listcomp>     nodes = [root] + [v for u, v in resnx]   File "/rhome/oaa9/anaconda3/envs/arkouda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/traversal/breadth_first_search.py", line 164, in bfs_edges     yield from generic_bfs_edges(G, source, successors, depth_limit, sort_neighbors)   File "/rhome/oaa9/anaconda3/envs/arkouda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/algorithms/traversal/breadth_first_search.py", line 75, in generic_bfs_edges     queue = deque([(source, depth_limit, neighbors(source))])   File "/rhome/oaa9/anaconda3/envs/arkouda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py", line 1240, in neighbors     raise NetworkXError(f"The node {n} is not in the graph.") from e networkx.exception.NetworkXError: The node 511 is not in the graph.
