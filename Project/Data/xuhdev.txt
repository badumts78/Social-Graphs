Confusing doc of networkx.Graph.copy : deep copy or shallow copy?#TITLE_END#The [doc](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.copy.html) reads as follows:  > The copy method by default returns a shallow copy of the graph and attributes. That is, if an attribute is a container, that container is shared by the original an the copy.   but later on, it reads  > Deepcopy – The default behavior is a “deepcopy” where the graph structure as well as all data attributes and any objects they might contain are copied.  Is this a deep copy or shallow copy?
