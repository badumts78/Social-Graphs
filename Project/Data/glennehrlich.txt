issue
Can not pickle a graph once an edge iterator is obtained#TITLE_END#The following script causes an error when pickling a graph. Commenting out the line calling the edges method allows the pickling to happen. If I manually pickle with any combination of pickle/cPickle and protocol, it still fails if I call the edges method. I see that recently `__getstate__ ` and `__setstate__` methods were added to view classes. Maybe there's something still odd there?  ``` # Python 2.7.13  import networkx as nx import pickle as pickle # import cPickle as pickle  n = nx.DiGraph() print 'num edges: {}'.format(len(n.edges())) # commenting out this line makes it work nx.write_gpickle(n, 'foo.gpickle')  ``` The error message is:  ``` num edges: 0 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "foo2.py", line 9, in <module>     nx.write_gpickle(n, 'foo.gpickle')   File "<decorator-gen-352>", line 2, in write_gpickle   File "/opt/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py", line 221, in _open_file     result = func(*new_args, **kwargs)   File "/opt/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/gpickle.py", line 70, in write_gpickle     pickle.dump(G, path, protocol) TypeError: expected string or Unicode object, NoneType found  ```
