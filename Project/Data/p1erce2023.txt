Fix `simple_paths` targets parameter#TITLE_END#  Hey, I've recently use `simple_paths` function. I found https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3074 which replaces `list` to `OrderedDict` speeds up it a lot. Thanks to that. But after that, I found https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3138/ a little misleading.  In the doc, there is no warning about it when we pass in parameters as targets, those should be **out-degree 0**. Otherwise it may not return all_simple_paths as this function name indicates.  Actually, I noticed the added doc itself is likely a misuse. ```         >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)         >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=[3, 2]):         ...     print(path)         [0, 1, 2]         [0, 1, 3]         [0, 2]         [0, 3] ``` in this complete_graph, nodes [2, 3] are not out-degree 0. So the result paths miss some simple path like [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 1, 3] ...  There also exists same mistakes in the test.  `path_graph` used in the test not creating using `DiGraph` do not have out-degree 0 nodes.  there is also a bug for the cutoff part in if branch (`# len(visited) == cutoff`) ``` G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from([(0,1), (1,2), (1,3)]) list(nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=[2, 3], cutoff=2)) ``` in this example, pervious code would only get 1 path (which should be 2 paths of course).  However, I think in one pass of DFS, we could enumerate `all_simple_paths` to many targets, **including but not limit to** leaf nodes (as out-degree 0). pls check the code below.   If that is OK, we do not need to restrict targets to be leaf nodes when we pass in more than one targets parameters.

Speed up simple_cycles#TITLE_END#Really appreciate your work on this wonderful lib. These are codes written by genius!  And, I found below example, ``` import networkx as nx g = nx.DiGraph() for i in range(10000):     g.add_edge(i, i + 1) g.add_path([10005, 10007, 10005]) g.add_path([10014, 10016, 10014]) list(nx.simple_cycles(g)) ``` runs surprisingly slow.  After I look into this, I would like to make 2 changes.  In Johnson's paper, >  Our definitions exclude graphs with loops (edges of the form (v, v)) and multiple edges between the same vertices.   So I would like to remove self-cycle edges out. This reduces huge amount of time. If you really want to do this (to be back compatible, although not consistent with its raw paper def), it would still be faster to check it in advance within O(n) time (I would add it if needed).  Another one is the component subgraph can be induced by `scc` nodes, which will also reduce some meaningless operation related with stack/blocked compared to subgraph `subG`.  Hope to make this lib even better! Would appreciate hearing your thoughts.
