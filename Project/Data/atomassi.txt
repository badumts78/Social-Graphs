Approximated Metrics - Diameter#TITLE_END#Hi all, In some cases, especially for large graphs, an exact result for a metric might not be necessary and a bound could be good enough.   This might be the case for the *diameter*, which currently on networkx is present only as an [exact metric](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.distance_measures.diameter.html).    I think it might be worth to add functionalities to computed an approximated diameter (i.e., a lower bound).   Good candidates might be the *2-sweep* [[1]](#1) and *2d-sweep* [[2]](#2)  for the undirected and directed case, respectively.   In addition to the results on the paper, here some comparisons made on my laptop (2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5) with a draft implementation of the *2-sweep* on undirected graphs considering the [Twitch Snap Dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch-social-networks.html).   Time is expressed in seconds. The code used can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/atomassi/3ee4d827afc6f7f20e3a70bba97ed697).   | network    	| \|V\| 	|  \|E\|  	| Time (exact) 	| Value (exact) 	| Time (LB) 	| Value (LB) 	| |------------	|:-----:	|:-------:	|:------------:	|:-------------:	|:---------:	|:----------:	| | musae_ENGB 	| 7,126 	|  35,324 	|     166.7    	|       10      	|    0.06   	|     10     	| | musae_RU   	| 4,385 	|  37,304 	|     63.2     	|       9       	|    0.03   	|      9     	| | musae_FR   	| 6,549 	| 112,666 	|     255.5    	|       7       	|    0.11   	|      7     	| | musae_DE   	| 9,498 	| 153,138 	|     602.7    	|       7       	|    0.18   	|      7     	| | musae_ES   	| 4,648 	|  59,382 	|     101.9    	|       9       	|    0.07   	|      8     	| | musae_PTBR 	| 1,912 	|  31,299 	|     17.5     	|       7       	|    0.02   	|      7     	|   If you think it might make sense to add this metric for the 2 cases, I can add a module (e.g., `networkx/algorithms/approximation/distance_measures.py`) with a proposed implementation and the tests for it.  ## References <a id="1">[1]</a>  Magnien, C., Latapy, M. and Habib, M., 2009. *Fast computation of empirically tight bounds for the diameter of massive graphs*.

Max Clique in Directed Graph#TITLE_END#Currently the [max_clique](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.approximation.clique.max_clique.html#networkx.algorithms.approximation.clique.max_clique) (approximated) function also works for directed graph  ```python >>> from networkx.algorithms.approximation import max_clique >>> D = nx.DiGraph() >>> D.add_edges_from([(1,2),(2,3),(3,1)]) >>> max_clique(G) {2, 3} ```  Should this function be decorated as `not_implemented_for("directed")`?

Fixed docs + added decorator for k_components#TITLE_END#Just re-added the decorator and updated the docs for the `k_components` function in the `networkx.algorithms.approximation` module.
