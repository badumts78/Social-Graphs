convert_node_labels_to_integers discard_old_labels=False behavior and docstring disagree#TITLE_END#The behavior of convert_node_labels_to_integers() in relabel.py is inconsistent with the documentation when discard_old_labels=False.   The docstring claims:  ``` If False, create a node attribute 'old_label' to hold the old labels. ```  The actual behavior is described in a comment (closing paren is missing in the source):  ``` #    preserve the original labels in separate dicts (these are not #    returned but made an attribute of the new graph. ```  The existing behavior is probably the more desirable option, but the docstring could use updating.  Additionally, it should probably be made clear that the mapping is made a _Python attribute_ of the _graph object_ -- _not_ a NetworkX graph attribute.
