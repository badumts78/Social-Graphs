attribute values may change when written then read by nx_pydot#TITLE_END#If an attribute value has a dot reserved character, the attribute value will be quoted when written by pydotplus.  But the reverse is not done when the value is read back.  In this example:  ``` python import networkx import networkx.drawing import tempfile  g1 = networkx.DiGraph() g1.add_node("foo", nodeattr=":FOO:") g1.add_node("bar", nodeattr=":BAR:") g1.add_edge("foo", "bar", edgeattr="FOO->BAR")  with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:         networkx.drawing.nx_pydot.write_dot(g1, f.name)         g2 = networkx.DiGraph(networkx.drawing.nx_pydot.read_dot(f.name))  print("G1:", g1.node["foo"]) print("G1:", g1.edge["foo"]["bar"])  print("G2:", g2.node["foo"]) print("G2:", g2.edge["foo"]["bar"]) ```  The value of the _foo_ node's _nodeattr_ attribute is changed from ':FOO:' to '":FOO:"'.  Similarly the _foo_ to _bar_ edge's _edgeattr_ attribute is changed from 'FOO->BAR' to '"FOO->BAR'".  Arguably, this could be considered a bug in the way that pydotplus handles attribute values. However, since nx_pydot already handles quoted node and edge id's (at least to some degree),  it should probably handle attributes as well.
