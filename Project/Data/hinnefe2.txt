Calling nx.fiedler_vector() on certain graphs hangs indefinitely#TITLE_END#In certain cases making a call to `nx.fiedler_vector` will hang indefinitely.   Minimum working example (for me this will hang indefinitely) ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_path([1,2,3,4]) G.add_edges_from([(5,3), (6,2)]) nx.fiedler_vector(G) ```  Some observations: 1. Calling the function with `method='lanczos'` works fine, it's only the default behavior that sometimes hangs.  2. A cursory look through the code / stack trace when interrupting suggests that the `while True:` loop at line 73 in `networkx/linalg/algebraicconnectivity.py` might be the culprit.
