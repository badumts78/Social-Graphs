Complete DiGraph with 2 Nodes is Incompatible with asadpour_atsp Function#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior Passing in the complete directed graph with 2 nodes to the asadpour_atsp function raises the error: networkx.exception.NetworkXError: G must have at least two nodes.  <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->  ### Expected Behavior The function should return the hamiltonian cycle of length 3 for the graph ([0, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 1]).  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  import networkx as nx  G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=1) G.add_edge(1, 0, weight=1) tsp = nx.approximation.asadpour_atsp(G)  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.13.2 NetworkX version: 3.4.2 Scipy version: 1.15.2
