issue
nx.wrtie_shp don't support string node#TITLE_END#Hi, I made a Graph from a file and give a string name to all my nodes. All the name are like "#52" or "#153". I based all  my script on this kind of variable. But when I want to export in Shape file with the function write_shp(G, 'path') I've got the following error :    File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/networkx/readwrite/nx_shp.py", line 168, in write_shp     g = netgeometry(n, data)   File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/networkx/readwrite/nx_shp.py", line 145, in netgeometry     fkey = [float(x) for x in key] ValueError: could not convert string to float: #  So I try to modify  nx_shp.py line 145: from this:  fkey = [float(x) for x in key]  to this: fkey=[] for x in key:       x=x[1:]       fkey.append(float(x))  But I still have the same problem, but wtih an empty space instead of '#' in the Value Error. I heard that networkx automatically generate a ID number to specify a node, can't we use this number ?
