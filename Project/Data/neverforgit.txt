issue
set_node_attributes creates dependency between node attributes#TITLE_END#I am not sure if this is an issue with the code, or we just need to update the documentation. I was trying to use `set_node_attributes` to initialize all nodes with a empty list for a 'cliques' attribute. I then want to fill in the lists with values appropriate for that node.   However, it appears each node's 'cliques' attribute is actually pointing at the same list in memory. So when I add a clique to one node, it adds it to every node's 'cliques' list.   If this behavior is intentional, it would be nice to update the doc to reflect this.   Thanks everyone for your work on NetworkX. I use it regularly.
