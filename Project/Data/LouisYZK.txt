issue
Why there are different results of shortest path in the Graph while using different API?#TITLE_END#I want get the shortest path in one graph and i try some apis like *The shortest_path_length, shortest_path, dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance*. but the results are different, some are right and some are wrong!  ```python a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h = range(8) G = {     a: {b:2, c:1, d:3, e:9, f:4},     b: {c:4, e:3},     c: {d:8},     d: {e:7},     e: {f:5},     f: {c:2, g:2, h:2},     g: {f:1, h:6},     h: {f:9, g:8} } nx_G = nx.Graph() edges = [(u, v, G[u][v]) for u in G for v in G[u]] nx_G.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)  print(dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance(nx_G, a)) print(shortest_path_length(nx_G, a)) print(shortest_path(nx_G, a)) ``` result: (path: {0: [], 1: [0], 2: [0], 3: [0], 4: [1], 5: [2], 6: [5], 7: [5, 6]}, distance:{0: 0, 2: 1, 1: 2, 3: 3, 5: 3, 6: 4, 4: 5, 7: 12})  {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 2} {0: [0], 1: [0, 1], 2: [0, 2], 3: [0, 3], 4: [0, 4], 5: [0, 5], 6: [0, 5, 6], 7: [0, 5, 7]}  First api output the wrong distance and path, the last one outputs alright, and the 2nd ignores the weight....  How could it be??
