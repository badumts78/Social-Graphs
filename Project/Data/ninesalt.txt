issue
max_flow_min_cost - total demand not zero#TITLE_END#<del>I'm working on a problem that involves calculating the best possible flow from many sources to many sinks. I do this by connecting all the sources to one "parent" source and the same thing for the sinks. I then execute the `max_flow_min_cost()` function on the graph but the following exception is raised:  <del>> NetworkXUnfeasible: total node demand is not zero.  <del>According the [documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.flow.max_flow_min_cost.html#networkx.algorithms.flow.max_flow_min_cost) for this function, it should do exactly what I'm trying to do and it should be fine with not satisfying all demands, but for some reason this is not happening. It raises an error which it should not raise.  <del>   Fixed. Found a few bugs in my code. ```
