Equitable coloring of graphs.#TITLE_END#WIP: Initial pull-request for adding equitable-coloring to the `networkx.algorithms.coloring`.  Closes #3042.

ENH: Addition of the Equitable coloring algorithm.#TITLE_END#I recently implemented an [equitable coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable_coloring) algorithm for degree bounded graphs from a paper by [Kierstead et. al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00493-010-2483-5) here: [musically-ut/equitable-coloring](https://github.com/musically-ut/equitable-coloring).   From Wikipedia:  >    In graph theory [..] an equitable coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices of an undirected graph, in such a way that > >   * No two adjacent vertices have the same color, and >   * The numbers of vertices in any two color classes differ by at most one.  ----  I wanted to get an idea of whether there is any interest in including `equitable_color` from my package as a potential coloring strategy under `networkx.algorithms.coloring`, next to the `greedy_color` strategies already there.  If so, I could work on a PR which will port the code and the test cases to `networkx`.
