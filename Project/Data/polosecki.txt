issue
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'write_dot'#TITLE_END#Error when  typing:  ``` import networkx as NX G=NX.grid_2d_graph(5,5)  # 5x5 grid NX.write_dot(G,"grid.dot") ```  This produces the error  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):    File "<ipython-input-4-742fbc2aa48b>", line 1, in <module>     NX.write_dot(G,"grid.dot")  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'write_dot' ```  The following libraries are installed: graphviz (0.4.9) pygraphviz (1.3.1) pydot (1.0.28) networkx (1.11)  It does seems as if, even though Python recognizes all the packages as installed, somehow networkx doesn't acknowledge it. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling all these packages, which happens successfully, but doesn't correct the issue.
