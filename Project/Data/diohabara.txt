issue
fix: make messages readable#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  Some messages are not properly separated by spaces.  E.g., when the following code (`main.py`) is run by `python main.py`,  ```python import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  def main():     G = nx.complete_graph(4)     pos = nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(G)     nx.draw(G, pos=pos)     plt.savefig("main.png")  if __name__ == "__main__":     main() ```  the execution result look like below.  ``` /home/user/main.py:6: DeprecationWarning: nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout depends on the pydot package, which hasknown issues and is not actively maintained. Consider usingnx.nx_agraph.graphviz_layout instead.  See https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5723   pos = nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(G) ```  However, this should look like below. Spaces are inserted between "has" and "known", and "using" and "nx.nx_agraph.graphviz".  ``` /home/user/main.py:6: DeprecationWarning: nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout depends on the pydot package, which has known issues and is not actively maintained. Consider using nx.nx_agraph.graphviz_layout instead.  See https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5723   pos = nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(G) ```
