Update gexf website link in documentation#TITLE_END#Hi, we've recently put the GEXF website again into its own domain http://gexf.net/ so this documentation should be updated. Thanks!  <!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->

Hi, I confirm that these two examples (before and after) aren't the same and Gephi won't recognize the latter as a dynamic graph. There's two things that can be dynamic in GEXF, the graph structure and the attributes. A dynamic graph structure means that elements (nodes or edges) have a certain time span and would appear/disappear when you manipulate the timeline filter in Gephi. In GEXF, one needs to set `<graph mode="dynamic">` and set `start` and/or `end` attribute directly on the `<node>` or `<edge>`. Dynamic attributes aim to represent a element attribute that varies over time, a stock price for example. To do that in GEXF, one needs to set `<attributes mode="dynamic">`. Each column represented by `<attribute>` within a dynamic `<attributes>` will then by dynamic and `<attvalue>` will accept `start` and `end` attributes. Note that it's possible to have a graph set at `static` and yet have attributes set at `dynamic`. The opposite is true as well: it's possible to have a dynamic graph but with static attributes (i.e. the attribute value will remain the same regardless the timeline filter). Hope this clarifies.

Hi, this was a Gephi bug and has now been fixed. The patch will be included in the upcoming 0.9 release (planned for 12/20). Thanks for reporting

And BTW, we're working on some adjustments on the GEXF format (version 1.3). You can see the discussion here: https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1152. Feel free to chime in if there's something that would make the interconnection between networkx and gephi easier. Much appreciated!
