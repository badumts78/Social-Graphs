issue
'DiGraph' object has no attribute '_node'#TITLE_END#Hi I am using Python3.6 and networkx2.5. Recently I received an error message:  --------------------------------------------------------- ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/classes/graph.py in __len__(self)     437      438         """ --> 439         return len(self._node)     440      441     def __getitem__(self, n):  AttributeError: 'DiGraph' object has no attribute '_node'  ---------------------------------------------------------  I googled the solution and it seems to be the problem of version. But I think I am using the latest version. Could you help me on this?
