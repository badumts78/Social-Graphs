issue
Which version of Networkx can be used with Python 2.7?#TITLE_END#Hi,  I am bound to using Python 2.7 and I'm trying to get NetworkX imported. I installed version 2.2 with:  `pip install 'networkx==2.2'`  However when trying to import it I still get the error that Python 3.5 is required:  `ImportError: Python 3.5 or later is required for NetworkX (2.7 detected).`  In the docs it says that NetworkX is available for Python 2.7, how can I get it?  Thanks!
