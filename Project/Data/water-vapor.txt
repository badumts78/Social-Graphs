min_weight_matching gives incorrect results#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  Consider the following graph: ```python G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge(1, 4, weight=2) G.add_edge(2, 3, weight=2) G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=1) G.add_edge(3, 4, weight=4) nx.min_weight_matching(G) ```  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> The program returns `{(2, 1), (4, 3)}` ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen --> There are two maximal matchings in the graph, (1,2)(3,4) with weight 1+4=5, and (1,4)(2,3) with weight 2+2=4. The minimum weight maximal matching should be (1,4)(2,3) which has weight 4. ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> Run the code provided ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9 NetworkX version: 2.7.1   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. --> From the documentation and the code, `min_weight_matching` is simply taking the reciprocal of the weights and uses `max_weight_matching`. This logic seems to be faulty in this example: 1/1+1/4>1/2+1/2.
