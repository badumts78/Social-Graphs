Generalized Modularity for Community Detection#TITLE_END#Is there any way we can integrate the generalized modularity into the current implementation of  > networkx.algorithms.community.quality > networkx.algorithms.community.modularity_max  The definition of the generalized modularity is just a simple extension of modularity with one extra \gamma parameter. And it can easily improve the resolution limit of modularity-based community detection.  See Newman's paper in 2016.  [Equivalence between modularity optimization and maximum likelihood methods for community detection](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.052315)

Fix issue #3153: generalized modularity maximization #TITLE_END#Complete #3153:   Add resolution parameter for `modularity_max` and `_naive_greedy_modularity_communities` in addition to the new definition of generalization modularity in #3238.  Write test case on Karate Club network, comparing the results of these two functions, because `_naive_greedy_modularity_communities` calls the `modularity` quality function directly.  Since the change of modularity `dq_jk` is actually part of the key for `MappedQueue`, `round()` is called to get `dq_jk`rounded, so the keys are not influenced by their numerical accuracy. We may upgrade this design of numerical `MappedQueue` keys in the future.
