Hi, I am having a similar issue using it in ipython:  ``` In [1]: import networkx as nx In [2]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt In [3]: G = nx.Graph() In [4]: G.add_nodes_from(range(1, 6)) In [7]: G.add_edge(1, 3) In [8]: G.add_edge(3, 5) In [9]: G.add_edge(5, 1) In [10]: G.add_edge(2, 1) In [11]: G.nodes() Out[11]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] In [12]: G.edges() Out[12]: [(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 2), (3, 5)]  In [13]: nx.draw(G) ```  And here is the output:  ``` /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py:126: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: pyplot.hold is deprecated.     Future behavior will be consistent with the long-time default:     plot commands add elements without first clearing the     Axes and/or Figure.   b = plt.ishold() /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py:138: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: pyplot.hold is deprecated.     Future behavior will be consistent with the long-time default:     plot commands add elements without first clearing the     Axes and/or Figure.   plt.hold(b) /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py:917: UserWarning: axes.hold is deprecated. Please remove it from your matplotlibrc and/or style files.   warnings.warn(self.msg_depr_set % key) /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib/rcsetup.py:152: UserWarning: axes.hold is deprecated, will be removed in 3.0   warnings.warn("axes.hold is deprecated, will be removed in 3.0") ```  PyPlot did create a plot, but looks like some things were deprecated in Matplotlib 2.0.0
