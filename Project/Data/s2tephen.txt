Betweenness centrality estimation accuracy/runtime discrepancies#TITLE_END#I'm trying to use the pivot/sampling method to estimate betweenness centrality and was running some tests to investigate the accuracy/runtime tradeoff when I encountered some unusual behavior. For a preferential attachment graph _G_, I took the actual betweenness centralities (where _k_ = `None`) and compared them against estimated betweenness centralities (where _k_ is set) to determine the maximum error, maximum % error, and runtime.  For each graph, I did this five times — for some reason, the first trial is always drastically different than the succeeding trials. It is significantly less accurate but runs far more quickly (see tables below for example data). Is there any particular reason this might happen? Can anyone else reproduce this, or could it possibly be a side effect of the way I've set up my tests? Any insight would be appreciated.  **V = 5000, E = 10000, k = 1000**  max error | max % error | runtime ---  | --- | ---  0.006448 | 202.7% |  27.6069428921 0.000099 | 36.6% | 138.638792038 0.000134 | 9.3% | 139.086478949 0.000150 | 5.6% | 139.093379021 0.000133 | 9.0% | 139.975478172  **V = 6000, E = 10000, k = 1000**  max error | max % error | runtime --- | --- | --- 0.011691 | 250.0% | 28.6789150238 0.000155 | 0.2% | 173.659012079 0.000166 | 7.1% | 173.779578924 0.000166 | 5.5% | 173.559407949 0.000165 | 2.1% | 173.367846012
