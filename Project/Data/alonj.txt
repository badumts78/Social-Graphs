Cut-off documentation in weighted shortest paths algorithms#TITLE_END#Hey,  The documentation for some shortest paths algorithms on weighted edges (mentioned below) explains the "cutoff" parameter to be:  > cutoff (integer or float, optional) – Depth to stop the search. Only return paths with **length** <= cutoff.  It seems confusing to me to use "length" here, which can also be "number of edges between nodes", rather than what is actually meant here "path weight" (or "sum of weights of edges between nodes"). Both metrics are valid on weighted paths, so perhaps it's better to make the distinction between "path weight" and "path length". It's a small change, but I've personally spent an embarrassingly long time finding it to be the case...  Suggested documentation:  > cutoff (integer or float, optional) – Depth to stop the search. Only return paths of **summed weight** <= cutoff.  This is relevant for the following functions: ``` networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.all_pairs_dijkstra_path_length networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.all_pairs_dijkstra_path networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.all_pairs_dijkstra networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.multi_source_dijkstra networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.multi_source_dijkstra_path networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.multi_source_dijkstra networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra_path_length networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra_path networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance ```
