issue
Changed arguments list of GraphMLWriterLxml.dump()#TITLE_END#Changed arguments list of GraphMLWriterLxml.dump to be consistent with the type of GraphMLWriter.dump. Otherwise, if we have some GraphMLWriterLxml A, and some user calls A.dump(stream) (maybe in the context of a function which takes a GraphMLWriter) then it will throw an error. This also makes static analysis tools happier, which reduces the amount of things to look at when debugging. <!-- Please run black to format your code.

OutMultiEdgeView.__call__ order of arguments#TITLE_END#### Discussed in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/6263  <div type='discussions-op-text'>  <sup>Originally posted by **patrick-nicodemus** December  7, 2022</sup> The __call__ method of `classes.reportviews.OutMultiEdgeView` is defined as: ``` def __call__(self, nbunch=None, data=False, keys=False default=None, ): ``` but the __call__ method of its parent class `classes.reportviews.OutEdgeView` is ``` def __call__(self, nbunch=None, data=False, default=None): ``` I would suggest that `keys` be moved to the last position. Otherwise if a user expects an OutEdgeView and gets an OutMultiEdgeView they will get a wrong answer.</div>
issue
Rearranged order of arguments in OutMultiEdgeView#TITLE_END#Rearranged order of arguments in OutMultiEdgeView to be consistent with the order of arguments in the parent class (new argument added to end). In the current implementation if somebody expects an OutEdgeView and gets an OutMultiEdgeView then the wrong parameters will be passed to the function.  <!-- Please run black to format your code.
