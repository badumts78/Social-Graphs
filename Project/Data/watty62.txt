Error when attempting to write a GraphML file after merging two graphs from imported GML files.#TITLE_END#Hi,  (i posted this on StackOverflow earlier today, but thought it advisable to raise it here too in case it is a known issue - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51612124/networkx-key-error-when-writing-gml-file )  I am getting the following error message when attempting to write GML file after merging two graphs using compose():  `NetworkXError: 'user_id' is not a valid key` The background is that I import two GML files using:  ``` g = nx.read_gml(file_path + "test_graph_1.gml") h = nx.read_gml(file_path + "test_graph_2.gml") ``` Each node (in both GML files) file is structured thus:  ``` node [ id 9 user_id "1663413990" file "wingsscotland.dat" label "brian_bilston" image "/Users/ian/development/gtf/gtf/img/1663413990.jpg" type "friends" statuses 21085 friends 737 followers 53425 listed 550 ffr 72.4898 lfr 0.1029 shape "triangle-up" ] ``` After importing each file, I can check all the node attributes, see that nodes are unique within each graph.  I also see that NetworkX by default discards the 'id' field, und uses the 'label' as the identifier of the node. It retains the user_id attribute (which happens to be a Twitter user_id and suits my purposes well).  Running  `list(f.nodes(data=True))` I can see that the data for the node above is:  ``` ('brian_bilston', {'ffr': 72.4898, 'file': 'wingsscotland.dat', 'followers': 53425, 'friends': 737, 'image': '/Users/ian/development/gtf/gtf/img/1663413990.jpg', 'lfr': 0.1029, 'listed': 550, 'shape': 'triangle-up', 'statuses': 21085, 'type': 'friends', 'user_id': '1663413990'}) ``` There is (in this test case) one common node shared by Graph g and Graph h, - the one shown above. All others are unique by user_id and label.  I then merge the two graphs using:  `f = nx.compose(g,h)` This works ok.  I then go to write out a new GML from the graph, f, using:  `nx.write_gml(f, file_path + "one_plus_two.gml")` At this point I get the error, above:  `  NetworkXError: 'user_id' is not a valid key ` I have checked the uniqueness of all user_id's (in case I had duplicated one):  ``` uid = nx.get_node_attributes(f,'user_id') print(uid) ``` Which outputs:  ``` {'brian_bilston': '1663413990',  'ICMResearch': '100',  'justcswilliams': '200',  'MissBabington': '300',  'ProBirdRights': '400',  'FredSmith': '247775851',  'JasWatt': '160952087',  'Angela_Lewis': '2316946782',  'Fuzzpig54': '130136162',  'SonnyRussel': '828881340',  'JohnBird': '448476934',  'AngusMcAngus': '19785044'} ``` (formatted for readability).  So, all user_id's are unique, as far as I can tell.  So, if it is not a question of uniqueness of keys, what is the error telling me?  I've exhausted my thinking on this!  Any pointers, please, would be very much appreciated!
