vertex-weighted path-finding#TITLE_END## What am I trying to do? Hi! I'm writing a tool that needs to find shortest paths basing off vertex attribs as the weight.  # Why can't `networkx` help me do it? From what I saw there are no methods for vertex-based path-finding in the package.   # What do I need? Routines for solving the paths in a vertex-based mode or a cool graph trick to convert a vertex-weighted graph to a edge-weighted equivalent.  # How can I help? I know a fair share of Python 3 and a teeny tiny bit about graph theory (BTW I'd be so screwed without this package, thanks!)
