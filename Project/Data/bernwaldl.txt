Improve modularity calculation#TITLE_END#I've improved the runtime of the modularity calculation for a partition of a graph and simplified the function.  As mentioned in #4095 the modularity function not appearing in the documentation prompted me to implement it myself. Based on ["Finding community structure in very large networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408187) and the lecture I was hearing at university, there is a more simplified approach to calculating the modularity of a partition of a graph. The simplification can be found in equation (7) in the [pdf of the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0408187.pdf).  The simplified calculation seems to run 3 times as fast as the original function on some graphs, at least judging based on one test on [this commit](https://github.com/bernwaldl/networkx/commit/a7f5a5247392f47f03918c36be92c361f6cc23b2) in [this branch](https://github.com/bernwaldl/networkx/tree/time_measurement).  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4204375/88311227-e9913580-cd10-11ea-82a3-a80063a34946.png)  As far as I can tell the calculation should also work for multi graphs and directed graphs. I've added multi and directed graphs in the tests and the new function returns, besides some very small rounding errors, the same as the old function. I am, however, not 100% positive, whether it yields the same result for all multi and directed graphs.  As this is my first pull request in the networkx repository, feedback is greatly appreciated 😃    
issue
Modularity does not appear on documentation website#TITLE_END#The function `networkx.algorithms.community.quality.modularity` is not featured on the [documentation website](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/community.html?highlight=quality#module-networkx.algorithms.community.quality) and cannot also not be found in [search](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/search.html?q=modularity&check_keywords=yes&area=default). The function does however have a documentation in the [source code](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/d0dbd76ca7129c83311cd9f42e5ca0061176d7f2/networkx/algorithms/community/quality.py#L243) and is marked as importable via `from networkx.algorithms.community.quality import *` in [this line](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/d0dbd76ca7129c83311cd9f42e5ca0061176d7f2/networkx/algorithms/community/quality.py#L14). This applies both to the latest and stable release.  Is it intentional that it does not appear on the website? Because not finding the function on the website caused me to implement it myself, which is not necessarily desirable.
