Replace is_chordal w faster algorithm and add independent set algorithm for chordal graphs#TITLE_END#Replaced the nx.is_chordal() function with a more effective version.  Acording to my measurement the new algorithm on chordal graphs is >=10 time more effective for larger cases  And on none chordal graph even if both algorithms runtime is a bit random on average my new algorithm was ~2 times faster.  Using the LexBFS algorithm and the characterisation of chordal graphs based on the existance of lexicographical order  I also implemented a maximum independent set algorithm for chordal graphs.
