Bridge finding algorithm#TITLE_END#I converted code developed by Peng Yu pengyu.ut@gmail.com and first published as a response to the networkx user mailing list on [May 31, 2012](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/networkx-discuss/5NcjIRUdSKc/Xcd6QTiuxDkJ) as well as to the [devel mailing](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/networkx-devel/rxgYXEVR3Sk/discussion) list.  The commit I based this on is here: https://github.com/pengyu/networkx/commit/6e79b612ed0d71ed514b3d8cdf82a3765d8363b6 - I moved the code to `bridges.py` in the `networkx/algorithms/` directory.  - I converted the provided tests into unittests that run (and pass) with nosetest as stipulated in the [CodeGuidelines](https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/wiki/CodeGuidelines). - I added documentation following the guidelines.
