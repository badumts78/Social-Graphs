Let operators take graph constructor kwargs#TITLE_END#Letting operators take graph constructor kwargs would enable classes derived by the user from graph classes and accepting constructor arguments to use the operators.  For `union`, for example, we'd have: ``` def union(G, H, rename=(None, None), name=None, **kwargs): ...     R = G.__class__(**kwargs) ... ```
issue
Misleading operator names#TITLE_END#Wikipedia provides the following on definitions of graph union:  - graph union: G1 ∪ G2. There are two definitions. In the most common one, the disjoint union of graphs, the union is assumed to be disjoint. Less commonly (though more consistent with the general definition of union in mathematics) the union of two graphs is defined as the graph (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2).  IMO, being consistent with the rest of mathematics is far more important than being consistent with some literature on the topic.  I also think that the operation of taking a union of two graphs (derived from set unions of the nodes and edges) is very useful.  And indeed, we provide two operators, union and disjoint_union, which would lead one to believe that the first is that operation, and that the second is some form of disjoint union.  Unfortunately, they both perform disjoint unions.  'union' does a set union of nodes and edges, but throws an error if the sets are not disjoint, or provides an ability to rename common nodes to avoid conflict. 'disjoint_union' throws out the node names altogether and renumbers the combined set of nodes.  We provide the functionality of graph union (as derived from set union of the nodes and edges) in an operator that is unfortunately called 'compose'.  There are various definitions of compose, including at least lexicographic and relational, of which I find relational to be more useful -- I don't believe we implement either.  This current state is a problem because people are likely to use a method called 'union' (especially when provided as an alternative to 'disjoint_union'), expecting it to operate in a manner different than it actually does.  They will likely be disconcerted to find that they have to go to to another method with an unrelated name to get the functionality they want.  It is also a problem because those wanting graph composition are likely to end up with graph union.  For another instance of confusion this causes, see [Issue #3422](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3422).  For those tempted to simply update the (formal) documentation, I feel strongly that variable names are by far the most important form of documentation.  My suggestion would be to remove the exception raise from the union operator, and to remove the compose operator entirely (so that it can later be replaced with something more appropriate).  I'm not aware of anything that would be lost be going to the version of union that doesn't raise the exception in place of using the current compose operator (are you?).  To highlight potential compatibility issues, at least removing 'compose', and perhaps both changes, could be done as part of a major release.  I can put together a PR for this if you agree.
issue
Relational compose#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> Related (circuitously) to Issue #4208.  Adds the relational_compose operator and updates to work with edge data attributes and to mix graph types.
comment
I suggest reopening this.  The fact that there is an operator called "compose" that is described in its documentation as performing a union (rather than a [composition]([url](https://igraph.org/r/doc/compose.html))) does not resolve this issue.  Until this is fixed, people will continue to waste time on it.  The union operator clearly operates in a manner different than described in its own documentation.
comment
Thanks, Dan.  I'm opening a new issue that expresses my concerns more directly.
