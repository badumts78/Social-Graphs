eigenvector_centrality() questions#TITLE_END#Hey there,  Am still very new to `networkx` and am, generally, getting my bearings on graph/network data, as a whole. All that to say that I'm hardly trying to come off as an `A C K T U A L L Y` pedant, nor outsource my critical thinking with this issue.  ------  Anyhow, my Linear Algebra chops aren't as developed as I'd like them to be and the concept of Eigenvector Centrality wasn't even remotely as intuitive to me as, say, betweenness. I really like [the book I'm using](https://smile.amazon.com/Complex-Network-Analysis-Python-Recognize/dp/1680502697?sa-no-redirect=1) to learn the space, however the section on centrality measures kinda glosses over the mechanics of Eigenvector Centrality, instead opting to share *conclusions*. Editorializing the three paragraphs a bit:  > ...the eigenvector centrality uses a recursive definition: 'Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are.'" ... Mathematically, the eigenvector centrality of a node is the sum of the neighbors' eigenvector centralities divided by `lambda`-- the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network.  > >High eigenvector centrality identifies nodes that are surrounded by other nodes with eigenvector centrality. You can use this measure to locate groups of interconnected nodes with high prestige."  And so I took to the source code to better-understand what this was doing and my questions are as follows:  1. 3blue1brown's Linear Algebra series has [a great video on Eigenvectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and really helped me cement a *geometric* intuition for Eigenvalues/vectors. However, I'm coming up blank, trying to superimpose this clear, elegant geometric interpretation to the adjacency matrix. Can someone help me intuit the significance of Eigenvalues/vectors in network science?  *I'm pretty green in the realm of numerical analysis, so bear with me on these next two*   2. For this comment chunk    https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/0ad939428a2eb1768103b634ed2b67386a2e7d48/networkx/algorithms/centrality/eigenvector.py#L115-L118  would it be more apropriate to say  ```     # Normalize the initial vector so that each entry is in (0, 1), exclusive.     # This is guaranteed to never have a divide-by-zero error by the previous line. ```  ? And if so, is there any value in making a baby-PR to change it? (Totally cool with "nope, lol", but willing to do it myself, if so)  3. More generally, is the gist of this method the same as [what he shows in this 20-second chunk](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&t=458)? And that "convergence" means that the vectors stayed "on the rails of the eigenbasis," compared to the last iteration?  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/0ad939428a2eb1768103b634ed2b67386a2e7d48/networkx/algorithms/centrality/eigenvector.py#L136-L137  If so, then I'm still unclear what the corresponding `v` values in `x` *mean*-- probably a direct extension of (1), now that I'm thinking about it...  4. I had to read up on power iteration to follow what I was looking at, for the most part. Was going to ask if there was a compelling reason why [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration) had a `numpy`/vectorized implementation and this function didn't... right up until I realized that there *was* [an implementation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality_numpy.html#networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality_numpy). So is there a good rule of thumb when I should be using one vs the other?  5. (Finally) Is there a better avenue for me to ask/rant questions like this? I know a lot of other libraries have Slack/Discord channels, or steer to a particular corner of Stack Overflow, but I didn't see anything either way [in the developer guide](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/developer/index.html). And like, totally cool if this is too small a library/community to warrant an off-site communication platform. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't shouting into the void/cluttering up a Bug Queue with... *gestures vaguely*  ----   Frankly, I've been a Data Scientist for some time now and find myself *extremely* interested in this domain. I hadn't had any meaningful exposure to it [until I attended an awesome workshop, a few PyCons ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkbMUrgzwMs). But even then, I went back to my day job, perpetually too busy to dig in more and it fell off my radar (boy, if I had a nickel...). That is, until my new job had me looking into Identity Resolution and brought me back to graphs, in a hurry.  IRL, I'm not sure I know anyone with more than a passing knowlege beyond LinkedIn, FB, and Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. Which leaves me at the mercy of what I can grok from Google, YouTube, and impulse buying every book I can get my hands on. Which ain't all bad-- book led me to a great tool. Now I'm just looking for a community of people as excited about this stuff as I'm growing to be.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk 🤷‍♂️
