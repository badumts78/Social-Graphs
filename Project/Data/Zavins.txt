Add Counting Independent Sets for Trees Using Dynamic Programming#TITLE_END#This code implements a dynamic programming algorithm for counting the number of independent sets in a tree (see e.g. http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/03-dynprog.pdf, Section 3.10). Independent set and clique (approximation) algorithms exist in networkx in general graphs, but nothing exact has been implemented for trees. We believe this begins to fill that gap. We implemented this algorithm as a component of an experiment on deterministic and randomized counting algorithms for counting independent sets in graphs, but we believe the algorithm may also be of general interest.
