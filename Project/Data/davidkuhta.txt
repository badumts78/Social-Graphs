Shell Layout incorrectly rescales for single element shells.#TITLE_END#Hi there!  I had a shell layout that used to work with the 1.1 release, but incorrectly overlaps nodes when there is only one element in the shell in the latest build.  Upon inspection, I believe the `rescale_layout` function to be the culprit. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/794323b9ca4fcd5bb270137ba2fe51bcb78b9a6f/networkx/drawing/layout.py#L252  For a two shell graph with one element in the outer shell: `nlist [[1], [2]]`, `shell_layout` outputs: `{1: array([0., 0.]), 2: array([0.0, 0. ])}` where it used to output: `{1: array([0., 0.]), 2: array([1.0, 0. ])}`  For a two shell graph with two element in the outer shell: `nlist [[1], [2, 3]]`, `shell_layout` correctly outputs: ``` {1: array([0., 0.]),  2: array([5.00000000e-01, 2.18556941e-08]),  3: array([-5.00000000e-01, -2.18556941e-08])} ```  We see in the `rescale_layout`, that the positions are being normalized. Unfortunately this means for single node shells, they shift to zero as it's position value is also the mean. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/794323b9ca4fcd5bb270137ba2fe51bcb78b9a6f/networkx/drawing/layout.py#L889  I believe a simple solution is to first check that there is more than one element: ```python if len(pos[:,i]) > 1:             pos[:, i] -= pos[:, i].mean() ```  This results in an acceptable set of positions, while not changing any instances for shells with more nodes: `{1: array([0., 0.]), 2: array([0.5, 0. ])}`  I'd be happy to submit a PR, once I check to ensure no other issues with the other layouts.

There may be a nuance with the reference to "in `networkx`". I believe `networkx`'s inherent plotting capability is intended for static plots as it's built atop `matplotlib` IIRC.  I have successfully used `plotly` in conjunction with `'networkx` to attain interactive graphs. For example: [Plotly - Network Graphs](https://plot.ly/python/network-graphs/)
