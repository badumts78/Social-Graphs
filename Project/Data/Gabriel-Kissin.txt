> Gabriel Kissin contacted me privately and mentioned the R packages tsna (Temporal Social Network Analysis) and ndtv (Network Dynamic Temporal Visualization)  Just came across this, thanks Kelly @boothby for locating this discussion and adding my two cents!   In connection to what the OP brought up about a natural way to _visualise_ changes in a network over multiple phases, I had to do this a bit in July. In case helpful to anyone else who comes across this page, IIRC I used the following approach: Imagine that all the phases are one long phase, and all nodes and edges belong in that one phase. This "combined phase" can then be visualised by merging the graphs from all the phases into one graph, and using standard visualisation methods (I found `nx.nx_agraph.pygraphviz_layout` and `nx.kamada_kawai_layout` worked well for me). So those methods will find a good layout for all the nodes in the "combined phase". Once that is done, the same layout can be used for the nodes in each separate phase, i.e. in every phase all the nodes will be in the position they are assigned in the "combined phase".    The advantage of this over simply visualising each phase as a new network, is that all nodes will now always be located in the same position. This makes visual identification of any changes far easier!  Another tip I found helpful was to output the visualisations for each of the phases as separate pages of one pdf. The pdf can then be opened (optionally set to full screen) and displayed with "Single Page View", so the mouse wheel etc doesn't scroll, but jumps pages. That way you can easily jump from one graph to the next and easily see what has changed. The last page of the pdf can be the combined graph with nodes from all phases. I'll upload a couple of examples of this, one using just a small subset of the network I was working with, the second using the entire network.  This won't help for the OP's request for "an option for edges to connect between timepoints", but for cases where phases are distinct then for primitive comparison between phases I found this was a very simple but very helpful approach.
