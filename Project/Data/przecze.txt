issue
networkx.draw() hides axes on different subplot#TITLE_END#I try to have a graph visualization on one subplot and a line plot of some values on another subplot. However, after I draw the graph on the first subplot, axes on the other subplot disappear (although I did not allow any shared axes). And I cannot bring them back. ``` import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt fig = plt.figure() ax1 = fig.add_subplot(211) ax2 = fig.add_subplot(212) G = nx.graph_atlas(1) nx.draw(G, ax=ax1) plt.show() ``` Results in `ax2` having the ticks for both axes hidden, whereas if I run the same code without `nx.draw(...)` line the ticks are visible on both subplots.  How is it possible that `nx.draw(G, ax=ax1)` affects `ax2`?
