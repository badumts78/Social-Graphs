`draw_networkx_edges` does not adhere to `g.edges()` order when self-loops are present#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior `draw_networkx_edges` seems to jumble formatting arguments for individual self-loop edges.    ### Expected Behavior Among other example, in the code snippet below, the upper right self transition should be orange and the upper left one pink. Luckily the normal edges seem to be formatted fine.  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` import networkx as nx g = nx.Graph() node_pos = {0:(0,0),1:(1,1),2:(0,1)} g.add_edges_from([(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,2), (2,1)]) print(g.edges()) nx.draw_networkx_edges(g, node_pos, edge_color=["red", "green", "orange", "blue", "pink"], width=[5,10,1,50,100]) ```  ### Environment Python version: 3.9 NetworkX version: 2.6.3   ### Additional context ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1241516/135012412-3da601be-1506-49f0-ac1c-cc1b4abb1df5.png)

Allow edge style to be a list of styles for DiGraphs#TITLE_END#Fixes issue where `DiGraph`s fail to allow a list of edge styles (or when enabling `arrows=True` for `Graph`):  ```python import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  g = nx.DiGraph() g.add_nodes_from([0,1,2]) g.add_edges_from([(0,1), (0,2)])  nx.draw_networkx_nodes(g, pos=[(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)]) nx.draw_networkx_edges(g, pos=[(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)], style=["-", "--"],) ```  This throws an error: ``` ValueError: Unrecognized linestyle: ['-', '--'] ```  The proposed pull request fixes this issue.
