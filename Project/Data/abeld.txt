issue
None is accepted as node identifier, but then degree() method breaks / changes behaviour#TITLE_END#As per the included shell example, None is accepted as a node identifier, but then calling degree() without an argument will return a number instead of a dictionary. This breaks code that assumes that degree() will return a dict in this case.  The bug is due to the the check at the beginning of degree(): "if nbunch in self:      # return a single node" see: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/classes/graph.py#L1351 since in this case 'if None in g' will return True, since there is such a node in g.  I am not sure what is the right fix -- even an explicit "if nbunch is None" won't be a full solution, since in that case "for n in g.nodes(): g.degree(n)" would break. Possibly None has to be prohibited to be used as a node? But that might also break various codes that use networkx.  ``` Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)  [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import networkx >>> g = networkx.Graph() >>> g.add_node(None) >>> g.degree() 0 >>> gg = networkx.Graph() >>> gg.degree() {} >>> networkx.__version__ '1.9.1' >>>  ```
