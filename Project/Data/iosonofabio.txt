Add iplotx to network drawing documentation#TITLE_END#After previous communication with @dschult and @tacaswell , the `iplotx` library (https://iplotx.readthedocs.org) was recently developed (by myself) to offer seamless network visualisation from both NetworkX and igraph:  - working with native data structures, with no need for file export/import - expanding the range of styling options compared to internal NetworkX functions - using well behaved matplotlib artists that can be animated or edited after the fact - ensuring correct behaviour across backends, DPI resolutions, zoom/pan operations  This draft PR proposes to add specific mentions and examples of `iplotx` into NetworkX's documentation to let users know that option for network visualisation is available.  For starters, I added a mention in the drawing reference docs and an example in the "external" subgallery.  It would be great if one of you guys could take a quick look and share your thought on this. The iplotx API is slowly crystallising but currently still fluid enough that adjustments can be made to simplify life for end users.  After an initial round of feedback on the concept, I'm happy to fix CI issues, polish details, etc. etc. to meet your usual standards for PR acceptance.  THANK YOU!

Omg...   1. You are right at the edge of your CI allowance and any additional example would kill it 2. iplotx depends explicitly on pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Maybe one of the first two trips CI? E.g. maybe it's trying to compile either from source? 
comment
Ok next guesses:  1. Somehow pylint made it as a full dependency of iplotx:  https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx/blob/13f3774ceeeee07e3cdd6ba02ad4484ee91254fc/pyproject.toml#L21  That is obviously a bug and I'll move it to optional. Could this be it?  2. I'm pinning versions of numpy/pandas to >=2.0, but that could change. Maybe numpy 2.0 is the culprit?
comment
Let me give it a think   "numpy 2.0 compliant" and "our CI provider will manage the dependency chain correctly once 2.0 is in the mix" are slightly different statements I suppose... Do you still get `Killed` if you get rid of iplotx but raise the numpy dep to 2.0 in networkx?
comment
Ouch... This is a really weird one. I'm not sure if it's great fun or no fun at all... I'll take a look once I'm in the office if that's ok
comment
Maybe that's why it's called CircleCI - folks tend to go in circles chasing the CI

Agree that is the likely cause, I suspected the same but it seemed uncanny to have hit the limit right at this particular moment. Then again, any moment is particular in some way.  Is it needed to run coverage and build-docs together _and_ in parallel _and_ in the same container? If this was one of my packages I would attempt in the following order:  1. Make a separate workflow for coverage that runs on separate container 2. Make them serial rather than parallel 3. See if there are specific examples that burn a lot of memory, and recast them as a little smaller 4. increase to 8GB  Just a few scattered suggestions though, from a non-maintainer of the package

My bad, I was changing some infra code for plotting communities and this one slipped through the cracks. I think we'll have a bugfix release for this, and then we should try and implement some plotting CI like you guys or mpl have.

Hi @jarrodmillman  Thank you for reaching out. Excited to see these two amazing projects come towards one another to the benefit of network scientists all around the globe!  Btw @szhorvat will be our speaker at the CZI EOSS conference, will you be there? (I will probably skip re time zone in Australia).  I'll take a look, I'm reworking igraph's plotting interface these very days. @vtraag or @ntamas might know too

Alright, so folks correct me if I'm wrong or you have a different opinion.  First, the current version of igraph's plot function tries a little too hard to create a temporary file and then use the "default" image viewer on the machine to open it. No surprise, it does not work great on CI where the concept of "opening" is fuzzy anyway. I am working on igraph/python-igraph#341 to include matplotlib axes as outputs. If you can wait the few days until that PR goes in, you can then pull igraph from master (or wait for the next release) and use the default matplotlib scraper in sphinx-gallery (I think there is one??).  Second, as an alternative, `igraph` can save the plot to a file quite easily:  ```python ig.plot(g, layout=layout, target='/my_folder/my_file.png') ``` so you can simply point it to the folder with the static assets (e.g. images) of your HTML sphinx output and then embed an `<img src=/my_folder/my_file.png>` tag into your documentation. I've not used sphinx-gallery before but this seems like a pretty easy bypass.  Unfortunately I can't help you scrape pixels out of a PNG or nodes out of an SVG (the two default representations by the current Cairo backend of igraph plotting), but options 1 or 2 look like better alternatives to me anyway.  Keep me posted!

Fantastic! The PR is ready AFAICT, @ntamas will have a look this or next week and then I can fix the last few things if needed, but it should be good enough to be useful.  That PR also includes some convoluted but potentially useful code to enable seamless autoscaling of directed edges (arrows) upon zoom in/out in matplotlib, especially via interactive backends (e.g. Qt5, Gtk) or via `ax.set_xlim(...)` and friends. Take a peek and search Ctrl+F for `callback` if you are interested in having something along those lines in networkx too :-)
comment
That PR has been merged into python-igraph master, feel free to pull from it or wait for the next official release.

On my system (linux 64 bit python 3.8) I just run:  ```bash git clone https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph.git cd  python-igraph python setup.py build (press enter when prompted) ``` then you'll have the compiled library in `build/lib.<system>-<python>`, in my case `build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.8` and you can add that to your `PYTHONPATH` and import (or move it and do whatever you want with it).  If that does not work, feel free to paste the commands and errors here and I'll try my best to assist. I am in the process of overhauling documentation, but it's far from perfect still ;-)
comment
Awesome. I have arch too (since 2006, man it's been a whlie) so debugging should be easier in the feature.
comment
Yep you are not trying to use the matplotlib interface. I've written the docs but chances are they aren't on the live doc server yet:  ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # First make a pyploy.Axes (this is a good idea in general) fig, ax = plt.subplots() ig.plot(g, layout=layout, target=ax) ```  You can modify your plot post facto using the `ax` variable.
comment
Haha that's a bug. I'll fix it ASAP, in the meanwhile you can try:  ```python ig.plot(g, layout=layout, target=ax, vertex_size=[5] * g.vcount()) ``` Sorry about that.
comment
Of course, I pushed the PR through a little hastily so it's suffering from a few youth issues. I'll push a fix in a few minutes.
comment
Alright, I pushed a fix for this and closely related issues onto igraph/master (commit 90e5625) right now, if you could git pull (or reclone) and retry it should work better (hopefully not worse!):  ```python ig.plot(g, layout=layout, target=ax) ```  should just work once an `Axes` is specified.
