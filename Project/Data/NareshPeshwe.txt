Thank you. I understood the flaws in my algorithm. For approximation guarantee I think I will have to find a minimum spanning tree on the sub-graph induced by the vertices obtained. But I think the algorithm in the Wikipedia article is clearer. https://gist.github.com/NareshPeshwe/28e50861ed1d591ef0d72fc5e497afc7 Does this look good?

Thanks a lot @jfinkels . Will do it. I just had one doubt. Shouldn't the steiner_tree function take in a set of terminal nodes as an input and return a steiner tree induced by only those nodes ?  And how do I undo the commit to the other pull request ?
