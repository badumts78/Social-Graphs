write graphs with datetime node attributes to graphml#TITLE_END#Graphs with `datetime` node attributes cannot be written to a graphml file.  This code ```python import networkx as nx import datetime  G = nx.Graph() G.add_node(1, date=datetime.date(2018, 4, 2)) nx.write_graphml(G, 'tst.graphml') ``` produces the following error ``` --------------------------------------------------------------------------- KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-14-54f001e720eb> in <module>()       4 G = nx.Graph()       5 G.add_node(1, date=datetime.date(2018, 4, 2)) ----> 6 nx.write_graphml(G, 'tst.graphml')  <decorator-gen-505> in write_graphml_lxml(G, path, encoding, prettyprint, infer_numeric_types)  /Users/iaincarmichael/anaconda/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/utils/decorators.py in _open_file(func, *args, **kwargs)     222         # Finally, we call the original function, making sure to close the fobj.     223         try: --> 224             result = func(*new_args, **kwargs)     225         finally:     226             if close_fobj:  /Users/iaincarmichael/anaconda/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py in write_graphml_lxml(G, path, encoding, prettyprint, infer_numeric_types)     147     writer = GraphMLWriterLxml(path, graph=G, encoding=encoding,     148                                prettyprint=prettyprint, --> 149                                infer_numeric_types=infer_numeric_types)     150     writer.dump()     151   /Users/iaincarmichael/anaconda/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py in __init__(self, path, graph, encoding, prettyprint, infer_numeric_types)     594      595         if graph is not None: --> 596             self.add_graph_element(graph)     597      598     def add_graph_element(self, G):  /Users/iaincarmichael/anaconda/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py in add_graph_element(self, G)     635                     attributes[k] = v     636         for k, v in attributes.items(): --> 637             T = self.xml_type[self.attr_type(k, "node", v)]     638             self.get_key(make_str(k), T, "node", node_default.get(k))     639         # Edges and data  KeyError: <class 'datetime.date'> ```  I'm using `networkx` version 2.0 and Python 3.6.  It would be nice to add `datetime` functionality to `nx.write_graphml()`.  It would also be awesome if this method could write graphs with more general objects as node attributes.

add transitivity for weighted graphs#TITLE_END#Right now the [`transitivity` function](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/cluster.py) is only implemented for binary, directed graphs. There is a weighted version of the transitivity statistic (see the appendix of [Complex network measures of brain connectivity: Uses and interpretations](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381190901074X), sorry for the paywall).  The appendix in that paper has a list of graph statistics that might be worth implementing in networkx (many of the already are). 
issue
shortest_path_length behavior in disconnected graph#TITLE_END#Currently shortest_path_length(G, u, v) raises an error if there is no path between nodes u and v. It might be worth changing this to return infinity (or at least adding the option to do so). Some algorithms, such as global_efficiency, treat the path length between two disconnected nodes as infinity.  
issue
bug in local_efficency #TITLE_END#The local_efficiency function is not computed correctly (I'm using python 2, networkx version 1.11)  The bug is in line 140 of [efficiency.py](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/efficiency.py) which is currently `return sum(global_efficiency(G.subgraph(G[v])) for v in G) / len(G)`  The issue is `G.subgraph(G[v])` returns the neighborhood subgraph of v **excluding** v. This is not the correct computation and, for example, leads to an error  ``` G = nx.Graph()  # triangle plus one node  G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4])  G.add_edge(1, 2) G.add_edge(1, 3) G.add_edge(2, 3) G.add_edge(1, 4)  local_efficiency(G) ```  raises `NetworkXNoPath: No path between 2 and 4.` When local_efficency calls global_efficiency on `G.subgraph(G[1])` it gets a disconnected graph. The fix for this error is simple i.e. replace line 140 with  `return sum(global_efficiency(nx.ego_graph(G, v)) for v in G) / len(G)`  (On a side note the efficiency.py file did not come with my networkx package -- I downloaded it directly from Github -- not sure why this happened?)
