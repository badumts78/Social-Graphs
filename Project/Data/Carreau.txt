Try to Remove autogenerate requirements files.#TITLE_END#Where possible in the github action use `.[...]` syntax  With the exeption  of lint that was not installing networkx and now does I hope that this should be identical  It does sometime merge a few pip command into a single one.  Note that some of those files are not autogenerated, so leave them.  One of the limitation is that the instructions to intall with conda (`conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements/extra.txt`) don't make sens anymore.  This would replace #7483  <!-- Please use pre-commit to lint your code. For more details check out step 1 and 4 of https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html -->

Try to make regenerating requirements unnecessary.#TITLE_END#Point back at `pyproject.toml` this might avoid a pre-commit and avoid out of sync things.

Do not use requirements file in github workflow.#TITLE_END#Removing them seem to be controversial for good reasons (see #7490), but we can already start by not using them in github action to see the effect on the build steps. This may alleviate some concerns later on.

I'll reply more in IPython's issue later, but project like https://github.com/deshaw/pyflyby allow autoimport, and it's also a bit what `ipython --pyplot` did.   It is problematic to autoimport in the end, as it tend to import typos, or users get confused as they don't understand once they actually need an import.  It goes to further than Just NX, example often reference function from same module.  As for adding a friendly suggestion at the end it is possible, We could try to catch the name error. Python 3.10 already have extended error messages to guess the rights names on attribute error, one of the problem being that CPython implemented it in C, and that with our custom formatter on IPython side we have to re implement the logic. See https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13450, one of the issues is we start to have many project that push for different traceback formatters.  - trio with exception groups,  - Python 3.10 with catching attributes errors and name errors - This.  - Projects like https://pypi.org/project/friendly-traceback/   I think that adding the imports automatically in the docs is a solution, but it won't fix everything as many example can also refer to items in the same module without explicit imports I believe.  I don't believe I'll currently have the time to implement that in IPython, but I'd love to sit-down at SciPy and talk Jupyter & documentation.   
comment
Cross posted from https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6755 , I don't think it should be a string, but a tuple of string, (cf discussion in ipython repo) and a method, not attribute (to be able to do some dynamic fetching like in submodules and equivalent. If we do that, it should really be uniform among scipy packages.   Also let's find a unique place to discuss that.

Note that we use `gh_api.py` which could maybe be merged with [pygithub](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub) to navigate github programmatically through python. There is also [hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub) that adds a lot of github magics to git, but in Ruby.

Note that this might make some of this work easier,   https://gist.github.com/3342247  and moreover, instead of fetching `refs/pull/*/head` you can fetch `refs/pull/*/merge` wich is already the current state merge into master.  That's actually how github does test how `This pull request can be automatically merged.`, by trying to merge, and see if it fails. Though, I don't know what `/merge` point to when merge don't work, but github api should tell you that's it's not mergeable.

> I still don't have a good understanding of git, so I don't have an informed opinion of the changes that you propose.  I dont know git well neither, I discovered it by mistake by mistyping what was in the gist.  I think that you could  Ask github api : Is it mergeable if so  clone `/pull/#pr/merge` and do it with a --depth of 1 as you'll need only the more recent commit. then run the test.  It should decrease the required bandwidth a lot.
