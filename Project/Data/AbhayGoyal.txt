Hey, I recently saw #4432 has already been closed. I am also a new comer and wanted to fix this issue. Can I now take this or is there any other that I can work on?
comment
Hey, maybe adding this feature might help. I guess just having a check should help ease out right? Correct me if I am wrong
comment
And where should we add it? Like this note

Hey @jarrodmillman, I am starting out and trying to contribute to open source. Can I do this task?
comment
Hey, maybe I could take this task next? 
comment
Hey, I was looking into this and was trying to understand the kind of change that would be needed? I would like to take on this task.  
comment
Agreed. Right now it is : G : NetworkX DiGraph A directed acyclic graph (DAG) I feel it should say: G : NetworkX DiGraph A directed graph  Would that be correct ? @dschult  
comment
Just created a PR for this

Hey @rossbar , Could I work on this issue? I am just starting to contribute in Open Source and wanted to this. 
comment
Thanks @rossbar. Could you tell me which document should I make the change to?
comment
I had a similar qs, I was also trying yo figure out where to make the changes
comment
I have changed the documentation for cutoff from length <= cutoff to summed weight <= cutoff. @dschult could you tell me where do have to change the parameter description. It is not present in the weighted.py file. Is there any other file where it is present?
comment
Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.         If given a value, we only process paths shorter than `cutoff`.        Only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.  Would this be a correct representation of what it is supposed to do? 
comment
Looks good.
comment
Hey, is this issue still needed, and if so what is to be done? I guess we can find max path cost in an undirected graph maybe using a set that checks we not getting into any cycles?
