set nx-arangodb link to github#TITLE_END#Updates the `nx-arangodb` link in Backends Gallery  Github Page has a video, which IMO is nicer to have vs. the RTD page

@eriknw interesting idea, could you give an example of how this could be used?  As it stands, `nx-arangodb` already supports something like this:  ```python import os import network as nx import nx_arangodb as nxadb  # Database credentials os.envrion["..."] = ...  G = nxadb.Graph(name="KarateGraph")  # Connect to existing graph  res = nx.pagerank(G) # Fetches graph from DB  nx.set_node_attributes(G, res, "pagerank") # Updates graph in DB ```  Are you suggesting something like this?  ```python import networkx as nx  G = nx.karate_club_graph()  res = nx.pagerank(G)  nx.set_node_attributes(G, res, "pagerank", backend="arangodb")  ```  I'm not quite sure if this would work for nx-arangodb, we would be assuming `G` already exists in the database if `set_node_attributes(..., backend="arangodb")` is called 🤔
