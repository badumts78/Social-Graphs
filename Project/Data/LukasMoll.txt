subgraph_view return corrupt graph when filter function is invalid.#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior ``` def filter_func():         return lambda x: x.real     graph = nx.DiGraph()     graph.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)])     filtered_graph = nx.subgraph_view(graph, filter_func) ``` filtered_graph = corrupt graph. <img width="1120" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 13 29 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86722560/214292049-6473548e-04a8-45c6-9179-666805e2bf31.png">   ### Expected Behavior  It should throw an error. If def filter_func is corrected: ``` def filter_func(x):         return lambda x: x.real ``` It'll return a normal graph e.g.: <img width="749" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-24 at 13 31 20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86722560/214292304-be9a79ba-d3e3-4637-9ca1-9cb07d3f6623.png">  ### Steps to Reproduce  See code snippet above.  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  IDE: PyCharm (that's where I got the images from) Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 3.0  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->

Feature: adding a testing module to NetworkX.#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  We currently have graph_equal.  When used in assertion this doesn't provide options like wether to include the graph date. It doesn't provide feedback.  ### Expected Behavior  We would like to have a testing module similar to Pandas and Numpy. You'd have options wether to compare data, nodes, edges etc. We would also like to get detailed feedback when the assertion fails.
