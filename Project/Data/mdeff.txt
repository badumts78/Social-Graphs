issue
handling of numpy dtypes#TITLE_END#Networkx doesn't seem to handle well attributes that are of NumPy types.  An instance of the problem is with writers. The following works with floating point dtypes, but fails for integer dtypes.   ```python import networkx as nx import numpy as np from scipy import sparse  adjacency = sparse.csr_matrix([     [0, 1, 2],     [1, 0, 0],     [2, 0, 0], ], dtype=np.float) graph = nx.from_scipy_sparse_matrix(adjacency)  type(graph.edges()[(0, 1)]['weight'])  # returns numpy.float64  nx.write_graphml(graph, 'graph.graphml') nx.write_gml(graph, 'graph.gml') nx.write_gexf(graph, 'graph.gexf') ```  By replacing `dtype=np.float` with `dtype=np.int`, we get the following: * For GraphML: `NetworkXError: GraphML writer does not support <class 'numpy.int64'> as data values.`. * For GML: `NetworkXError: 1 is not a string`. * It works for GEXF, and is saved as an int (e.g., `<edge id="0" source="0" target="1" weight="1" />`).  Other instances of the general problem I could find are #2204 and #3322.  Wouldn't the best approach be to internally convert NumPy dtypes to Python types?

There's two different issues here: 1. Unquoted labels, i.e., `NetworkXError: expected an int, float, string or '[', found 'n42' at (4, 5)`. 2. Missing labels, i.e., `NetworkXError: node #0 has no 'label' attribute`.  If 1) is non-compliant, I think it's fair to fail, or to ignore the label.  For 2), I don't think the standard requires a label. As a fallback, NetworkX should use the `id`. Note that Networkx does just that when importing a gexf with missing labels.  ## Missing label example  For example, the following code produces a GML file that is not readable by NetworkX (while readable by graph-tool, gephi, and cytoscape).  ```python >>> import graph_tool as gt >>> import networkx as nx  >>> graph = gt.Graph(directed=False) >>> graph.add_edge(0, 1) >>> graph.save('graph_gt.gml')  >>> G = nx.read_gml('graph_gt.gml') NetworkXError: node #0 has no 'label' attribute ```  `graph_gt.gml`: ``` graph [    node [       id 0    ]    node [       id 1    ]    edge [       id 0       source 0       target 1    ] ] ```
