missing import for graphviz_layout#TITLE_END#When importing `networkx`, the functions from `networkx.drawing.nx_pydot` are not included in the `networkx` namespace. This causes the errors for the [example](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_agraph.graphviz_layout.html#networkx.drawing.nx_agraph.graphviz_layout) and other use cases.  ``` python >>> import networkx as nx >>> G=nx.petersen_graph() >>> pos=nx.graphviz_layout(G) >>> pos=nx.graphviz_layout(G,prog='dot') Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> AttributeError: module 'networkx' has no attribute 'graphviz_layout' ```  **EDIT**: Additionally:  ``` python >>> nx.draw_graphviz(G) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py", line 984, in draw_graphviz     pos = nx.drawing.graphviz_layout(G, prog) AttributeError: module 'networkx.drawing' has no attribute 'graphviz_layout' ```  Here is the current `networkx/drawing/__init__.py`  ``` # graph drawing and interface to graphviz  from .layout import * from .nx_pylab import * from . import nx_agraph from . import nx_pydot ```  To fix this issue, there should be `from .nx_pydot import *` instead of `from . import nx_pydot` since these functions aren't being populated into the namespaces properly. Perhaps it's this way because it's not assumed that a user has graphviz and pydot/pygraphviz, so maybe a more clever use of imports could be the solution.
