Delete redundant dependencies in the DAG graph#TITLE_END#In the recent module dependency processing, I found that in order to better analyze, it is necessary to deal with the redundant dependencies in the DAG graph. So a simple implementation was made according to the asterix314's reply at https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/33638/remove-redundant-dependencies-from-a-directed-acyclic-graph. the result is exactly the same as Wolfram Mathematica, and the code runs rather fast. I don't know if the community welcomes such code. I will post it below first. I may improve the code and raise a PR and contribute if it is OK and needed.   ```python from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix import networkx as nx  def reduceDagGraph(DAG):     '''delete redundant dependencies in the DAG graph'''     # Algorithm from the link：     # https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/33638/remove-redundant-dependencies-from-a-directed-acyclic-graph     A = nx.adjacency_matrix(DAG)     cnt = 1 # DEBUG     B = A     S = csr_matrix(A.shape, dtype=A.dtype)     while True:         B = B*A         B = B.sign()         S = S+B         cnt += 1         p = B.nnz         print(f"cnt:{cnt}, p:{p}") # DEBUG         if p==0:             break     S = S.sign()     A_and_S=A.multiply(S)     A_diff_S = A-A_and_S      # Generate the result graph based on the adjacency matrix and the name list of the original graph     new_DG = nx.from_scipy_sparse_matrix(A_diff_S, create_using=nx.DiGraph)     map = {index:str(name) for index, name in enumerate(DAG.nodes())}     new_DG = nx.relabel_nodes(new_DG, map, False)     return new_DG ```
