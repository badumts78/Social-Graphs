Community detection#TITLE_END#Addressing #7643  Changes   Remove Limitation on Community Generator: Instead of limiting the generator to a specific iteration by directly using [0], the community generator  Node Coloring Function: The `create_community_node_colors` function has been adjusted to ensure nodes are properly colored across all iterations.  Modularity Bar Plot: The bar plot visualizes the modularity trend as the number of communities increases. It provides insights into how well the network is divided at different stages.

ENH remove 'c/cw' edge attribute when converting PlanarGraph to Graph#TITLE_END#Addressing #7645    Changes: Remove the `cw ` and `ccw` attributes: After converting the directed graph to an undirected one, we loop through all the edges and explicitly remove these attributes. Usage Example: The example usage at the end demonstrates how the `PlanarEmbedding.to_undirected()` method works and how it removes the unwanted attributes from the undirected graph.  Explanation: The `to_undirected()` method first calls the `super().to_undirected(reciprocal=True)` to get the basic undirected version of the graph. Then, it iterates over all edges in the graph, checking for and removing any `cw` and `ccw` attributes that remain from the directed edges

Community detection#TITLE_END#Addressing #7643   Changes made:  `communities_generator` is used to generate communities iteratively from the Girvan-Newman algorithm for the first four iterations.  In `create_community_node_colors()`, `number_of_colors` is now based on the number of communities, not the number of nodes in the first community.
