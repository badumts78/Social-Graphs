issue
single_source_dijkstra sometimes returns paths that don't match up with distances#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior On a particular graph I'm working with, there are a few pairs of nodes where the shortest distance is _not_ len(path) - 1. In particular, for two nodes 0 and 1, the path is [0, 1], but the distance is 2.0. This can be seen in the "Additional context" section. Most pairs work as expected.  ### Expected Behavior The distance in this case should be 1.0.  ### Steps to Reproduce Put `bug_demo.py` and `dijkstra.edgelist` into the same directory and run `python bug_demo.py`. [bug-report.zip](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/files/6820206/bug-report.zip)  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9.5 NetworkX version: 2.5.1  ### Additional context I'm pretty sure that the problem is with distances rather than with paths, as I originally noticed the bug when looking at one side of a bipartite graph - I expected all of the distances to be even numbers, but some of them were odd.
