[A-star] Added expansion pruning via cutoff if cutoff is provided#TITLE_END#Added a cutoff to limit the exploration of a large, potentially disconnected graph. The use-case is highlighted in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/7026.  Reasoning for implementing this in A-star:  It is not directly mentioned in papers that a cutoff can be added. However, since it's not an unknown concept (as also implemented in Dijkstra), I think the [original paper on A-star](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/TSSC.1968.300136) highlights it the best. Going by the definition of the evaluation function f:  $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$  where $g(n)$ is the actual cost from source to $n$ and $h(n)$ is the actual cost of an optimal path from $n$ to the target.  It is then given for A* to be admissible that our heuristic $h'(n)$ must be $h'(n) <= h(n)$. I.e. when $g(n) + h'(n) > cutoff$, we are guaranteed that no path exists from $n$ to the target that satisfies the cutoff. Meaning, we could essentially add the cutoff check before enqueueing a node (and simply `continue` if it fails this check), or terminate the search when the algorithm explores a node $n$ that fails the cutoff check since $n$ would have the lowest $f(n)$ in the queue.  I've opted for the former since it reduces the memory footprint by applying the cutoff early.
