How to combine all same node by using networkx #TITLE_END#How to combine specific node by using networkx ?  Here is part of my gml file First thing is to read the gml file into networkx, after reading the file, i want to combine all 'shu.edu.tw'  into one node For instant：id 0 and id 4 have the same  'shu.edu.tw' , i want to combine id 4 into id 0, same thing does the id 5 and 6, and all the edges have to make up to the previous one.   ```  graph [   directed 1   multigraph 1   node [     id 0     label "https://www.shu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 1     label "https://www.facebook.com"   ]   node [     id 2     label "https://www.instagram.com"   ]   node [     id 3     label "https://www.youtube.com"   ]   node [     id 4     label "http://cc.web.shu.edu.tw"   ]   node [     id 5     label "http://donate.web.shu.edu.tw"   ]   node [     id 6     label "http://english.shu.edu.tw"   ] ```

how to keep specific node in networkx#TITLE_END#My problem is i can remove all the node i don't want but i want to keep some specific node. Here's how i do it. 1.read gml into networkx 2.using this code to remove the website that i don't want and then write it into a new gml file ```import networkx as nx G = nx.read_gml('test.gml') for i in range(2000):     for node in G.nodes:         if "pu.edu.tw" not in node:             G.remove_node(node)             break nx.write_gml(G,"finaltest.gml") ``` 3.As you can see some part of the gml file, i successfully keep all 'pu.edu.tw' website   ``` graph [   directed 1   multigraph 1   node [     id 0     label "https://www.pu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 1     label "https://alumni.pu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 2     label "https://freshman.pu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 3     label "https://tdc.pu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 4     label "https://alcat.pu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 5     label "https://www.secretary.pu.edu.tw/"   ]   node [     id 6     label "https://pugive.pu.edu.tw/"   ]  ``` 4.The problem is when i try to draw this gml file with networkx, i got some nodes without egdes ![Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56836973/100747642-49b18a00-341d-11eb-88a1-7d75bdce0db1.png)  5.And i found out the reason is that I deleted the link related to 'pu.edu.tw' so there are some egdes missing  I want to know how to not only remove the website i don't want and keep specific node that related to 'pu.edu.tw' so that edges won't missing. or some way to reconnect node. Thank you.

read_gml encoding error#TITLE_END#### It seems like my GML file included Chinese texts, so whenever i try to read gml it gives me "input is not ASCII-encoded" error. So is there any way to keep the Chinese texts and make this program work at the same time? ![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56836973/81538317-2fd92880-93a1-11ea-9144-d0719cbdf2ff.JPG) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56836973/81538378-42ebf880-93a1-11ea-8f02-6fd79bcbff69.png) ``` import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt G = nx.read_gml('Data_sets/test.gml')  pos = nx.circular_layout(G)  # nodes nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=100) # edges nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos)  # labels #nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)  #print (nx.info(G)) #print (nx.is_directed(G)) #nx.draw_random(G) plt.axis('off') plt.show() ```  This is my GML file (removed due to length)
