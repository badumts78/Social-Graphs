Add Leiden algorithm file#TITLE_END#This is a work in progress of the Leiden's algorithm implementation.  I've included a new Leiden.py file with the algorithm implementation (which is not complete yet) which is basically a copy of the Louvain's file but with the relevant changes for Leiden.  Up until now: - I have added both the Leiden_communities and leiden_partitions functions (following the Louvain's implementation) and I have changed the Louvain's code corresponding to the 'Local moving' phase to turn it into 'Fast local moving' for the Leiden's '_one_level' function. - I have also included the description of the algorithm (for the documentation), including the bibliography. - I tested these changes with a simple example and it seems to work fine (as in not throwing any errors but I will have to test for graphs that have different output from Louvain than Leiden)  I'm missing: - The implementation of the refinement phase  - Changing the parameters of the _gen_graph function once I have the refined partition. - Adding tests (which I might need guidance in order to do them).   A couple of questions for @dschult:  - The code of _convert_multigraph, _gen_graph and _neighbor_weights remains the same for both algorithms. Should I leave them as they are which means defining them exactly the same in the leiden.py file or should I make them available from the louvain.py file and call those ones.  - Does it make sense to keep these two functions in separate files or does it make sense to group them?  I'll keep working on the refinement phase and upload some code soon.

Louvain algorithm throws ZeroDivisionError with graphs that have no edges.#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  I'm running the Louvain algorithm with a graph that has no edges and it raises a ZeroDivisionError.  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):    File /opt/anaconda3/envs/networkx/lib/python3.11/site-packages/spyder_kernels/py3compat.py:356 in compat_exec     exec(code, globals, locals)    File ~/Local/Dev-Repos/networkx/networkx/algorithms/community/test1.py:22     print(nx.community.louvain.louvain_communities(G))    File ~/Local/Dev-Repos/networkx/networkx/utils/decorators.py:766 in func     return argmap._lazy_compile(__wrapper)(*args, **kwargs)    File <class 'networkx.utils.decorators.argmap'> compilation 8:4 in argmap_louvain_communities_5     import inspect    File ~/Local/Dev-Repos/networkx/networkx/algorithms/community/louvain.py:111 in louvain_communities     q = deque(d, maxlen=1)    File ~/Local/Dev-Repos/networkx/networkx/algorithms/community/louvain.py:167 in louvain_partitions     mod = modularity(G, partition, resolution=resolution, weight=weight)    File ~/Local/Dev-Repos/networkx/networkx/algorithms/community/quality.py:239 in modularity     norm = 1 / deg_sum**2  ZeroDivisionError: division by zero ```  ### Expected Behavior  Modularity should be undefined for a graph with no edges so the output of the Louvain algorithm probably should be 'NetworkPointlessConcept'.  ### Steps to Reproduce  G = nx.Graph() G.add_nodes_from(range(10)) nx.community.louvain.louvain_communities(G)  ### Steps to Solve  Inside the louvain_partitions function (in louvain.py), before the line `mod = modularity(G, partition, resolution=resolution, weight=weight)` there should be a check for the degree of the graph and if the degree is zero, the function should probably just break and return  'NetworkPointlessConcept'.  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.11 NetworkX version:

Fixed unused root argument in has_bridges#TITLE_END#This fixes #5636 and it is ready to merge!  1. I added the root argument in the `nx.bridges` call in the `has_bridges` function.  2. I added tests for the `has_bridges` function since they were missing.  3. I fixed the bridges function when there is more than one connected component.  4. I added tests for chain decomposition function.  <!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->

@dschult I did send you a hackmd with some content some days ago on discord. But I can paste it here as well.   https://hackmd.io/FeKAZe9IQoqR1tL2bbe9ZQ

NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.  Comment  It allows users to load and store networks in standard and nonstandard data formats, generate many types of random and classic networks, analyze network structure, build network models, design new network algorithms, draw networks, and much more.  NetworkX is a open source library, which means that is free for everyone to use and anyone can contribute to it. For more information, you can visit one of the following resources:  :globe_with_meridians: Our [website](https://networkx.org/) where you will find general information about the project.  :book: Our [documentation page](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html) where you can learn how to use the library.  :octocat: Our [repository](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) where you can learn how to use the library.  Thank you for supporting our project! Your sponsorship will help us to mantain and grow our library in order to make scientific computing more open and accessible. :sparkles:

No worries @dschult. I'll use GitHub next time 🙈. Please let me know if I can help with something else.
