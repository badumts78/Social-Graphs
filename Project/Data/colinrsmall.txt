issue
Can't set layers in a shell_layout with nodes added from add_weighted_edges_from(): 'Node 'foo' has no position.'#TITLE_END#`g = nx.Graph()`  `g.add_weighted_edges_from(test, 'weight')`  `weights = [w['weight'] for t,f,w in g.edges(data=True)]`  `labels = [t for t,f,w in g.edges(data=True)]`  `nx.draw(g, nx.shell_layout(g, [list(g.nodes())[0],list(g.nodes())[1:]]), width=weights, with_labels=True)`  Test is a list of tuples containing the necessary to, from, and weight values for the edges. Importing the edges and building graphs of any layout works fine. However, as soon as I try denoting which nodes belong in which layers, I am met with a 'Node 'foo' has no position' error.   Solutions to this problem for other layouts suggest building the layout first, however I don't know if its possible to add the list of nodes per layer after the fact.
