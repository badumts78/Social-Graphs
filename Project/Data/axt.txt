issue
Hashing inconsistencies(?) when using DiGraph#TITLE_END#I found some strange behaviour of DiGraph. This is the simplest example I could come up with to demonstrate it.  If I create a class with custom hash function like this:  ``` class X(object):     def __init__(self, x, s):         self.x = x         self.s = s;     def __hash__(self):         return self.x     def __eq__(self, x):         return x.x == self.x     def __str__(self):         return "label=%s hash=%d" %(self.s, self.x) ```  and then build this simple graph:  ```     g = nx.DiGraph()     g.add_node(X(1,"1a"))     g.add_node(X(2,"2a"))     g.add_edge(X(1,"1b"), X(2, "2b"))     g.add_edge(X(1,"1c"), X(2, "2c")) ```  Edge iterations:  ``` for s,t in g.edges():     print '%s -> %s' % (s,t)     for ss, tt in g.out_edges(s):         print '\tout\t%s -> %s' % (ss,tt)     for ss, tt in g.in_edges(t):         print '\tin\t%s -> %s' % (ss,tt) ```  will produce this results:  ``` label=1a hash=1 -> label=2b hash=2     out label=1a hash=1 -> label=2b hash=2     in  label=1b hash=1 -> label=2b hash=2 ```  So the two `add_edge` produce only 1 edge, which I guess its the expected behavior, since the hashes are the same. What is strange, that the source node is `looked up` and changed to `1a` while the target node is not, and remains `2b`. Another oddity is when we do the `in_edges` iteration, which will return `1b` although in the `edges` and `out_edges` we see only `1a`.
