issue
Pydot vs Agraph `write_dot` inconsistencies#TITLE_END#Behavior between the generated `.dot` file between `agraph` and `pydot` drawing is inconsistent. `agraph` is what I would expect the dot file to look like. Below is the code to reproduce the issue.  Code: ``` import networkx as nx import networkx.drawing.nx_pydot as pd import networkx.drawing.nx_agraph as ag  g = nx.DiGraph([(0,1),(1,2)]) pd.write_dot(g, 'pd.dot') ag.write_dot(g, 'ag.dot') ```  ag.dot ``` strict digraph "" {         0 -> 1;         1 -> 2; } ```  pd.dot ``` strict digraph  { 0; 1; 2; 0 -> 1; 1 -> 2; } ```
