Fix weighted MultiDiGraphs in DAG longest path algorithms + add additional tests#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. -->  Fixes #5987   Personally, I would find it useful to return the edge that was calculated to be the best in addition to the node to avoid having to recalculate it again whenever traversing the path, but that would break backwards compatibility with code that is using MultiDiGraphs for unweighted longest pathing by changing the return type, so I have not included it in my fix. A potential other fix would be to create separate functions for MultiDiGraphs and add a warning to dag_longest_path and dag_longest_path_length when a MultiDiGraph is supplied—preserving backwards compatibility while notifying developers about the function's inability to compute with weights.
issue
Weighted MultiDiGraphs never use weights in dag_longest_path and dag_longest_path_length#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior Given any MultiDiGraph, using dag_longest_path will always evaluate using the default_weight keyword argument.  This is because dag_longest_path uses `G.pred[v].items()` to grab the data dictionary, but the data dictionary for a MultiDiGraph is embedded inside of another dictionary with the edge number as a key. When dag_longest_path calls `data.get(weight, default_weight)` on this, it will always raise a KeyError on weight and use default_weight instead.  dag_longest_path_length also calls dict.get() on the wrong dictionary, making it return bad results for weighted MultiDiGraphs even if dag_longest_path returns the correct path.  ### Expected Behavior A MultiDiGraph should either evaluate correctly using weights or raise a NotImplementedError.  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` MDG = nx.MultiDiGraph([("A", "B", {"cost": 5}), ("B", "C", {"cost": 10}), ("A", "C", {"cost": 40})]) print(nx.dag_longest_path(MDG, weight="cost"), nx.dag_longest_path_length(MDG, weight="cost")) # prints ['A', 'B', 'C'] 2  # should be ['A', 'C'] 40 ``` Incorrect paths are especially noticeable when a weight key is given, but default_weight is set to 0, as it will always return a list containing only the starting node. ### Environment  Python version: 3.10 NetworkX version: 2.8.5  ### Additional context  I have a fix for this issue ready if you would like the functions to support MultiDiGraphs.
