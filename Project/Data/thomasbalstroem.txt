Geometric network downstream accumulation#TITLE_END#Hi all,  lI'm new to Networkx and very impressed how easy and quick I can carry out a downstream and upstream tracing in a graph.   Now, does anyone know, if I can use NetworkX to accumulate water volumes being transported downstream in a so called geometric network (GN)?    What I'm interested in is presented in Figure 7 in my article from Computers & Geosciences [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2018.04.010]:  Long story told short: I have a graph with nodes representing sinks, and edges representing downstream water paths from sink to sink. What I need to consider is if there is a spill over at each sink (node). If yes carry the spill over along the downstream edges into the next sink, consider if there is a spill over etc.   Are you aware of any NetworkX alghorithm(s) that can do so for a hierarchical network?
