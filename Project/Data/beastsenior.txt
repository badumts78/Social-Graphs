How to use remove_edges_from() funtion with in_edges() funtion? #TITLE_END#I am new to use networkx (networkx 2.0). I tried following codes:  ``` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import networkx as nx Gstar = nx.star_graph(4) Gstar = Gstar.to_directed() a=Gstar.in_edges([0]) print(a) Gstar.remove_edges_from(a) # Gstar.remove_edges_from([(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)]) # Gstar.remove_edges_from(eval(str(a))) nx.draw(Gstar, with_labels=True) plt.show() ``` got errors: ``` [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)] Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/GO/work/mycloud/360Cloud/program/networkx_test/2.py", line 8, in <module>     Gstar.remove_edges_from(a)   File "C:\Users\linger\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\digraph.py", line 753, in remove_edges_from     for e in ebunch:   File "C:\Users\linger\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\reportviews.py", line 736, in <genexpr>     for nbr, dd in nbrs.items()) RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration ``` but it will work by following codes: `Gstar.remove_edges_from([(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)])` or `Gstar.remove_edges_from(eval(str(a)))` So how to use remove_edges_from() funtion with in_edges() funtion correctly? Thanks.
