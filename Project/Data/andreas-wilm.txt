GML: added support for reading multi-line values#TITLE_END#This PR adds support for reading GML files with multiline entries. Currently NetworkX fails reading those files. The multiple lines are concatenated by space. This is achieved by introducing a buffer called `multilines`.  Fixes #6836 
issue
Multi-line entries in GML files not supported#TITLE_END#I am dealing with GML files that contain string entries spread across multiple lines. Networkx cannot parse such entries (Cytoscape for example can).  ### Current Behavior  Parsing GML files with multi-line entries fails with  `NetworkXError: cannot tokenize...`.  ### Expected Behavior  Networkx should be able to parse those entries  ### Steps to Reproduce  Example GML file:      graph     [ 	    node 	    [ 		    id 0 		    label "multiline node" 		    label2 "multiline1 	    multiline2 	    multiline3" 		    alt_name "id 0" 	    ]     ]  Example code:      nx.read_gml("multiline.gml")     # fails with NetworkXError: cannot tokenize...  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  <!--- Please provide details about your local environment -->  Python version: 3.9.7 and 3.11.4 NetworkX version: 2.6.3 and latest (git commit ff9c27b40)  ### Additional context  Already working on a fix
