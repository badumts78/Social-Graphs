issue
nx.relabel_nodes does not relabel nodes when exported to JSON#TITLE_END#I have a graph and I relabel the nodes:  `g2 = nx.relabel_nodes(g, items, copy=False)`  However when I go to export the graph to JSON format, the node `id`s have changes but the edge `id`s have not.  e.g.,   `json_graph.node_link_data(g2)`  results in   `[{'id': 'canary'}, {'id': 'crocodile'}, ... 'links': [{'source': 0, 'target': 26, 'weight': 1}, {'source': 0, 'target': 7, 'weight': 1}, ... `  Which obviously is no use, because I don't know which number goes with which label.

This bug just cost me three days of my time, so I second using `my_random=random.Random(seed)`.   Personally I would prefer to pass it a random seed rather the an instance of random.Random, but I can see the merit in that as well.

@NeilGirdhar No, you could still create a single random number generator (e.g., `my_random=random.Random(seed)`) and save that. Whenever you make a call to generate a graph, pass it `seed=my_random.random()`. You can create as many graphs as you like this way, each with a different random seed, same as your method.  If you pass a random number generator, it's not easy to read your code and see what will be returned. If you pass `seed=1232`, you know you'll always get the same result. If you pass `seed=my_random`, you may or may not get the same result depending on the order of the calls.  I realize that not everyone wants to use the stock `random` number generator, and that's a legitimate concern, but seems like a very rare case.

@NeilGirdhar I wouldn't call it roundabout. The difference for the end user is literally a matter of `my_random` vs `my_random.random()` and nothing else.  My second point is that if you see a call that has `seed=1234` you know that code will return exactly the same thing every time. If you see a call that has `seed=my_random` or `seed=my_random.random()` you don't know that it will return the same thing every time unless you know exactly how many times `my_random` has been called previously. My suggestion allows you to use `seed=1234` for clarity, but `seed=my_random.random()` when necessary.
