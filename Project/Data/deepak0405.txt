issue
Two different formula's used for personalised pagerank#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->  ### Current Behavior  I was looking into the algorithm used for the personalised page rank [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/pagerank_alg.py) . There are two implementations with the personalisation vector, but for both the implementations the formula's are quite different.  _pagerank_python  ```     if personalization is None:         # Assign uniform personalization vector if not given         p = dict.fromkeys(W, 1.0 / N)     else:         s = sum(personalization.values())         p = {k: v / s for k, v in personalization.items()} ```  _pagerank_scipy  ```     if personalization is None:         p = np.repeat(1.0 / N, N)     else:         p = np.array([personalization.get(n, 0) for n in nodelist], dtype=float)         if p.sum() == 0:             raise ZeroDivisionError         p /= p.sum()  ``` If there are k personalised nodes and n total nodes, then in first algorithm the probability values would be 1/k, where as in second case it would be 1/n  ### Expected Behavior  As per the personalised page rank algorithm, the probability value 1/k should be used in the formula.  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  ### Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug -->  ### Environment  Python : 3.11.4  Python version: NetworkX version: 3.2.1  ### Additional context  <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
