issue
[Bug] NetworkX returns negative flow values on some setups#TITLE_END#I have an undirected graph of about ~1000 nodes and 300 max feasible flow and compute a flow using min_cost_max_flow. I use integer costs and weights.  I used a recursive algorithm to go from my source to my flow target (it basically swaps edge target with edge source and checks neighbors). It prints the following  ``` # {Neighbor id: flow} {449: 2} # node after my source {448: 2} # Following nodes are a path {417: 2} {418: -2959} {447: 41} {817: 66} {450: 66} {451: 107} {446: 108} {992: 110} {787: 110} {1017: 323} # my sink ``` Now 3000 - 41 sure rings a bell since its my edge capacity minus, I suppose, the flow on that arc.  I use Networkx 2.2 on python 2.7 if that helps.
