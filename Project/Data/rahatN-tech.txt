networkx.draw_networkx() is giving extra edges in a pandapower network#TITLE_END#### Discussed in https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/7016  <div type='discussions-op-text'>  <sup>Originally posted by **rahatN-tech** October 13, 2023</sup> i want to draw a graph of ieee14 pandapower network, but the graph is giving 20 edges which should be 15. i got correct graph in many other networks, but this particular case is creating this issue..plz see the code below..  `import pandapower.networks as nw import networkx as nx  net = nw.case14() pp.runpp(net)  mgraph = top.create_nxgraph(net) net.bus_geodata.loc[0,'y'] = 5 net.bus_geodata.loc[0,'x'] = 3 net.bus_geodata.loc[10,'y'] = 0.75  pos = {} for n in range(len(net.bus.index)):     x = net.bus_geodata.loc[n, 'x']     y = net.bus_geodata.loc[n, 'y']     node_pos = {n: (x, y)}     pos.update(node_pos) print(pos) nx.draw_networkx(mgraph, pos, node_color='#808080')`    please look into it thanks in  advance </div>
