Update degree_alg.py#TITLE_END#In the original degree_alg.py, edge weights are ignored when computing the degree centrality.  I think the edge weights should be considered.  The annotation is as follows. Parameters         ----------         nbunch : single node, container, or all nodes (default= all nodes)             The view will only report edges incident to these nodes.          weight : string or None, optional (default=None)            The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value used            as a weight.  If None, then each edge has weight 1.            The degree is the sum of the edge weights adjacent to the node.  <!-- Please run black to format your code.
