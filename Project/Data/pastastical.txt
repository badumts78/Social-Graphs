issue
Simple path with data restaint#TITLE_END#Hi!  Hopefully this is a good place to ask a question.  I'm trying to find simple paths between all nodes while restricting the possible next paths to a range of data values in the current path. I'm using datetime, but a simplified example would be:  Edges in G: ( A, B ,val=1 ) ( B, C, val = 5 ) ( B, D, val = 8 ) ( B, E, val = 2 ) ( B, F, val = 12 ) ( E, G, val = 3 ) (E, H, val = 6) I'd like to say nx.all_simple_paths(G,iterative_edge_data_restraint=2) and have the results [ (A,B), (B,E), (E,G) ] because The edge data for edge(A, B) is 1 and data for edge(B, E) is the only edge from B which also has a data value within 2 units of edge(A, B)'s data value.   Also edge(E,G) is included because it has a data value within two units of edge(B, E)'s data value  I don't know how to do that from the documentation i can find.
