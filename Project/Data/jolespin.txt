[Question] Implementing Temporal Networks (e.g. Timeseries)#TITLE_END#Is there any documentation on using [MultiDiGraph](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9.1/reference/classes.multidigraph.html) to build [temporal networks](http://statnet.csde.washington.edu/workshops/SUNBELT/current/ndtv/ndtv_workshop.html) with a forward directing time component?   Also, do any algorithms apply to temporal networks in networkx?    I found https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/temporalisomorphvf2.py for one of the algorithms but it's not clear how this would work for multiple timepoints.   A natural visualization for this would be the following with an option for edges to connect between timepoints.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9061708/63227146-6da17b80-c198-11e9-9b8d-df69ac970c96.png)

`style` doesn't work for directed graphs#TITLE_END#There's no use of the `style` argument.  I ended up adding `linestyle=style` and it worked for the `FancyArrowPatch`              arrow = FancyArrowPatch((x1, y1), (x2, y2),                                     arrowstyle=arrowstyle,                                     shrinkA=shrink_source,                                     shrinkB=shrink_target,                                     mutation_scale=mutation_scale,                                     color=arrow_color,                                     linewidth=line_width,                                     connectionstyle=connectionstyle,                                     zorder=1)  # arrows go behind nodes  Here's a screenshot of using the function: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9061708/63396793-2e804f80-c37d-11e9-9e12-f919aaa033e5.png)

How to know which arguments can be used for graphviz_layout? #TITLE_END#``` Signature: nx.nx_agraph.graphviz_layout(G, prog='neato', root=None, args='') Docstring: Create node positions for G using Graphviz.  Parameters ---------- G : NetworkX graph   A graph created with NetworkX prog : string   Name of Graphviz layout program root : string, optional   Root node for twopi layout args : string, optional   Extra arguments to Graphviz layout program ```  What are the `args`? In particular, I'm interested in neato.  Are there additional parameters that I can use for this?   Also, do you know of any 3rd party packages designed specifically for additional networkx layouts?

[Feature Request] Topological overlap implementation in networkx? #TITLE_END#I cannot express how valuable this function would be if it was implemented in `networkx` because as of now I have to use `rpy2` with a very specific environment to use `WGCNA`.  This function takes in an adjacency matrix as a graph and calculates the topological overlap for it.  I usually use this resulting matrix as my fully-connected networkx graph.   Ideally it would be really useful if there could be 2 functions: `topological_overlap_from_pandas_adjacency` => from a pandas datafame `topological_overlap` => from a networkx graph`  Here is the original function from WGCNA:  https://rdrr.io/cran/WGCNA/man/TOMsimilarity.html  This seems to be a wrapper for some `C` backend? but I'm not entirely sure since I don't know `C` at all.  https://github.com/cran/WGCNA/blob/master/src/networkFunctions.c  Please let me know if this sounds appealing and I can try to help out.   Example of this usage in this [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/21/325407)  ```python import pandas as pd import networkx as nx from sklearn.datasets import load_iris import numpy as np  # Get iris data def iris_data(return_target_names=True):     iris = load_iris()     # Iris dataset     X = pd.DataFrame(iris.data,                      index = [*map(lambda x:f"iris_{x}", range(150))],                      columns = [*map(lambda x: x.split(" (cm)")[0].replace(" ","_"), iris.feature_names)])      y = pd.Series(iris.target,                            index = X.index,                            name = "Species")     if return_target_names:         y = y.map(lambda k: iris.target_names[k])     return (X, y)  # Force range (-1,1) into (0,1) def signed(X):     return (X + 1)/2 X, y = iris_data() # print(X.shape, y.shape) # (150, 4) (150,)  # Create pairwise correlations and force values between (0.0-1.0) df_adj = signed(X.T.corr()) # print(df_adj.shape) # (150, 150)  # Topological overlap wrapper that uses the function above # This code essentially just converts the pandas dataframe to r-matrix  # runs the computation and then brings it back into pandas df_tom = topological_overlap_from_pandas_adjacency(df_adj) # print(df_tom.shape) # (150, 150)  # Fully-connected tom graph graph = nx.from_pandas_adjacency(df_tom, create_using=nx.Graph(name="iris")) # print(graph.number_of_nodes()) # 150 ```

Feature request: Option for Bokeh backend#TITLE_END#Is it possible to add a feature like in `Holoviews` to choose between `matplotlib` and `bokeh` (possibly `plotly`) as a backend for the figure output in future versions?   Bjorn Meier describes a method on how this could be achieved: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlpeQJqzOfA

Does this support any hashable for node names? For example, if  we used a `tuple` or `frozenset`?
