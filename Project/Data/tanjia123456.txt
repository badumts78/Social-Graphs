Construct adjacency matrix based on node pairs#TITLE_END#hello, I have a node-node.txt. `0  1   1  5   5  0   6  5   5  1   1  6   0  56   56  1`  In each row, the first number is the starting node index, and the second number is the ending node index. How to construct the adjacency matrix by node pairs

use vertex and triangle ,how to create a graph?#TITLE_END#hello, I have vertex.txt and triangle.txt, how to create a networkx graph? my source file hasn't edge information  I have used matplotlib to create a graph, but I can't use nx.adjacency_matrix(G) function to get adj_matrix.  My ultimate goal is to generate adjacency matrix

Hello, I also want to use networkx to draw a 3D graph. In addition, if I use matplotlib to draw a three-dimensional graph, how can I find its adjacency matrix?
