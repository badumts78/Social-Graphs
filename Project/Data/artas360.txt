List ordering in kosaraju_strongly_connected_components#TITLE_END#Hi all, After switching form networkx1.8.1 to 1.9 I noticed that the order of the list returned by `kosaraju_strongly_connected_components` seems to be reversed.  ``` import networkx as nx G=nx.DiGraph() G.add_edges_from([(1,2),(2,1),(1,0),(2,0)]) [_ for _ in nx.kosaraju_strongly_connected_components(G)] ```  In 1.8.1 returns: `[[1, 2], [0]]` In master (cloned last week) returns: `[[0], [1, 2]]` -> Contradicts the doc  Did I miss something?  Thanks for all your work.  Regards.
