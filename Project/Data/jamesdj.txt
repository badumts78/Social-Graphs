issue
read_dot() is extremely slow#TITLE_END#I'm using a program that outputs graphs in .dot format. I was using networkx on a machine on which I could install GraphViz and pygraphviz, so I read in the .dot files with pygraphviz and converted them with `from_agraph()`. But I'd like to run code on several other machines on which I don't have permission to install GraphViz. Networkx's `read_dot()` function circumvents the need for GraphViz. The problem is that `read_dot()` is much slower (by more than two orders of magnitude) than functions for reading in graphs in other formats. Why is this? Can anything be done about it? If not, any ideas for workarounds? And perhaps some warning about the speed could be given in the documentation; otherwise, someone looking to read .dot files may unwittingly choose the parsimonious `read_dot()` option rather than the faster indirect way via pygraphviz or pydot.   ``` import networkx as nx rg = nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(100, 0.25, directed=True) nx.write_graphml(rg, "rg.graphml") nx.write_dot(rg, "rg.dot") %timeit foo = nx.read_graphml("rg.graphml") ```  10 loops, best of 3: 28.2 ms per loop  ``` %timeit foo = nx.read_dot("rg.dot") ```  1 loops, best of 3: 4.31 s per loop  Note that `write_dot()` is also slow compared to its counterparts for other formats, but the discrepancy is smaller.  ``` %timeit nx.write_graphml(rg, "rg.graphml") ```  10 loops, best of 3: 60 ms per loop  ``` %timeit nx.write_dot(rg, "rg.dot") ```  1 loops, best of 3: 487 ms per loop
