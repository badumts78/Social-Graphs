Fix slow implementation of networkx.algorithms.community.quality.performance#TITLE_END#Hi,  I was using the quality function **performance** on a small graph with 4039 nodes 88234 edges and 186 communities, but the current implementation takes minutes to complete, while using the alternate implementation of functions **inter_community_edges**, **inter_community_non_edges** and **intra_community_edges** (which you have # commented in the code) takes a fraction of a second.  Why do you prefer the current implementation over the alternate one? The alternate is clean, easy to understand and way faster.  Thanks.
