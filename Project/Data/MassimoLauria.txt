Construction `complete_bipartite_graph` does not set the 'bipartite' node attribute.#TITLE_END#The complete bipartite graph generator does not set the 'bipartite' attribute. This is particularly problematic since the `complete_bipartite_graph` is the fallback method for `bipartite_random_graph(n,m,p)` when `p>=1` and for `bipartite_gnmk_random_graph(n,m,k)` when `k>=n*m`. Therefore the latter graph generators may not set the 'bipartite' attribute, despite what is documented. The obvious fix is to make `complete_bipartite_graph` set the node attribute, too. 
comment
There is a problem with this patch: the vertices [0,n1) should have attribute `bipartite=0` and the vertices [n1,n1+n2) should have attribute `bipartite=1`.   The way it is in this new path is inconsistent with the other bipartite constructions,. This is particularly problematic since constructions as `bipartite_random_graph(n,m,p)` fallback to `complete_bipartite_graph(n,m)` for `p=1` which results as a sudden flip of the `bipartite` attribute.  Furthermore: wouldn't be better to rename `complete_bipartite_graph` to `bipartite_complete_graph` for consistency, and maybe keep the old name as an alias?
