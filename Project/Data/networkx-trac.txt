single_source_dijkstra algorithms with multiple target nodes (migrated from Trac #717)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/717 Reported 2012-04-16 by t.r.etherington, assigned to @hagberg.  I need to apply Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths from a single source node to a subset of other nodes on what will be a large graph.  Given the subset of nodes I'm interested in are generally going to be quite "close" to the source node, I don't want to have to apply Dijkstra's algorithm across the whole graph as the shortest paths to my subset of nodes will probably be found well before the entire graph has been processed.  Presently I can use single_source_dijkstra and specify a target node to stop the algorithm once a single node from my subset has been reached, but doing this for each node in my subset of target nodes is also going to be computationally wasteful, as on each occasion Dijkstra's algorithm will have to start again from scratch, and will have to repeat the same initial searches multiple times.  I'm wondering if it would be possible to extend the "target" parameter of single_source_dijkstra to accept not just a single node, but also a list of nodes?  It would also be very useful to have such an option with single_source_dijkstra_path and single_source_dijkstra_path_length as I will have occasions when I only need the paths or the path lengths.

Shortest path, where you have to pass through a certain node(s) (migrated from Trac #488)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/488 Reported 2011-01-05 by ziggy.jonsson.nyc, assigned to @hagberg.  Thanks for an excellent library, it's opened my eyes to networking and allowed me to view problems in a different perspective.  I was wondering how difficult it would be to have conditions to shortest path.  In particular I was thinking about conditioning shortest path so that it must pass through certain nodes (if such nodes are provided).   The path can not backtrack once it reaches any of those conditioned nodes, i.e. it must go another way out than it came in.  I could do this by copying the graph and removing last edge for each required node, but that would be a waste of memory since I would end up copying all the data.

"nondeterministic" behavior (migrated from Trac #300)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/300 Reported 2009-12-22 by @chebee7i, assigned to unknown.  I'm trying to write some unit tests for in converting networkx graphs to pygraphviz graphs.  There are probably other ways of testing, but I am now curious about the behavior I was seeing.  Essentially, the string representation of the graph is not constant and seems to fluctuate.  Is there anyway this can be made "deterministic"?  That is, if the graph's nodes/edges are created in the same order each time, then the string representation of the graph should be the same each time as well.  Currently, this does not appear to be the case.  Is this because the underlying graphviz implementation is using an unordered data structure?  Strangely, if you run the code sample below multiple times, you get "deterministic" behavior.  That is, it will fail on the same iteration EACH time (or so it seems).  The exact iteration it fails on seems to depend on the system, the file size, or something else....try, for example, to add "import os" at the top of the code snippet.  For me, it failed (repeatedly) on iteration 2 with the import. Without the import, it failed (repeatedly) on iteration 4.  ''' import pygraphviz  i = 0 x = None while i < 50:     i += 1     print i  ``` g = pygraphviz.AGraph(directed=True) g.add_edge(0,1) g.add_edge(0,2) g.add_edge(2,1) y = g.to_string()  if x is not None:     if x != y:         print x         print          print y         break  x = y ```  '''

Add Borukva's (or modified) algorithm for minimum spanning tree (migrated from Trac #422)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/422 Reported 2010-09-06 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C5%AFvka%27s_algorithm  Faster algorithms can be obtained by combining Prim's algorithm with Borůvka's. A faster randomized minimum spanning tree algorithm based in part on Borůvka's algorithm due to Karger, Klein, and Tarjan runs in expected O(E) time. The best known (deterministic) minimum spanning tree algorithm by Bernard Chazelle is also based in part on Borůvka's and runs in O(E α(V)) time, where α is the inverse of the Ackermann function. These randomized and deterministic algorithms combine steps of Borůvka's algorithm, reducing the number of components that remain to be connected, with steps of a different type that reduce the number of edges between pairs of components.  The attached code has an basic example implementation. See code for references to original sources.  Also see source:networkx/networkx/algorithms/tests/test_mst.py for some tests using Kruskal's algorithm which might be helpful.

Adding multigraph handling to astar_path function (migrated from Trac #731)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/731 Reported 2012-06-10 by rtk08, assigned to @hagberg.  Version 1.6 astar_path function does not support shortest path calculation for multigraphs - a NetworkXError exception is thrown.  Finding the shortest path with an A Star algorithm for a multigraph currently requires reducing it to a graph with single (directed or not) edges between any two nodes. This is very inefficient, particularly if the graph in question is large.  I will modify the the astar_path function to handle path finding in multigraphs.

triangles, clustering coefficent for directed graphs (migrated from Trac #669)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/669 Reported 2012-01-02 by unknown, assigned to @hagberg.  based on Newmann book Networks: An Introduction (2010) one can count triangles see chapter 7.9 : "It is however possible to generalize transitivity to take account of directed links. If we have a directed relation between vertices such as “u likes v” then we can say that a triple of vertices is closed or transitive if u likes v, v likes w, and also u likes w. (Note that there are many distinct ways for such a triple to be transitive, depending on the directions of the edges. The example given here is only one of six different possibilities.) One can calculate a clustering coefficient or fraction of transitive triples in the obvious fashion for the directed case, counting all directed paths of length two that are closed and dividing by the total number of directed paths of length two."

directed clustering coefficient (migrated from Trac #688)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/688 Reported 2012-02-14 by vhatzopoulos, assigned to @hagberg.  The directed clustering coefficient was introduced in  'Clustering in complex directed networks'  Phy.Rev.E 76, 026107 (2007)  This coefficient can be implemented both for weighted and unweighted versions.  The coefficient can be further subdivided into four components 'cycle','middle','in','out', when taking into account the direction of edges and the isomorphisms of all possible triangles.  A function signature could take the form directed_clustering(G,nodes=None,weight=None,type) with type:string('cycle','middle','in','out')  I am willing to provide a draft or assist with any more information.

Estrada index (migrated from Trac #605)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/605 Reported 2011-07-22 by trac user franckkalala, assigned to @hagberg.  In chemical graph theory, the Estrada index is a topological index of protein folding. The index was first defined by Ernesto Estrada as a measure of the degree of folding of a protein,[1] which is represented as a path-graph weighted by the dihedral or torsional angles of the protein backbone. This index of degree of folding has found multiple applications in the study of protein functions and protein-ligand interactions.  [1] E. Estrada, Chem. Phys. Lett. 319, 713 (2000).

Add features to get_edge_data method (migrated from Trac #583)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/583 Reported 2011-06-25 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  The get_edge_data method should be enhanced with keyword control of what gets returned.     The motivation for this change is to make it simpler to write algorithms that access edge data, especially when handling multigraphs.  See #574 for a detailed discussion and examples.  The proposed signature is: '''  G.get_edge_data(u,v,key=None,data_key=None,default=1,missing=None,combine=list) ''' Briefly, when '''data_key is None''', this is like '''G.adj[u][v]'''.  But when '''data_key''' is specified, this is like '''G.adj[u][v].get(data_key, default) '''  If the edge doesn't exist, '''missing''' is returned.  The '''key''' and '''combine''' arguments are used only for multigraphs.  If key is specified, use the same behavior on the data dict '''G.adj[u][v][key]'''.  If '''key is None''' and '''data_key''' is specified, the list of values obtained is sent to the function combine, which defaults to '''list''', but common examples would be '''min''' or '''sum'''.  This is not backward compatible since the current method uses the '''default''' keyword to supply a value when the edge does not exist instead of when the edge data key does not exist as proposed here.  Suggestions on other desired features?  names for arguments?  anything else?

Many real-life graphs are too big to be downloaded and analyzed in their full size. Examples are WWW or Online Social Networks.

They are rather simple (though the weighted versions may be a bit tricky) and you will find them in many textbooks. I think, it would be really useful to include this module in networkx. Please, let me know what you think.

Currently, to_undirected() makes a deep copy of the graph.  It might be nice to have the returned graph be a "view" where only the structure is rebuilt (but all the graph, node, edge data is the same).  This would additionally require adding the reverse of every edge...this would make the returned graph not a pure "view".  Use case?  Perhaps people might be interested in seeing how their directed graphs behave in undirected graph algorithms (without having to do an expensive deepcopy).

Cumulative nomination scheme as a centrality measure (migrated from Trac #261)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/261 Reported 2009-08-17 by trac user dheerajrav, assigned to @hagberg.  Cumulative nomination scheme, also known as CNS is a centrality measure which works on the principle of ranking a graph based on the nominations it gets.  The individuals(nodes) in a graph gets the initial nomination of 1. and at every stage, each individual(node) gets additional nominations their contacts already have( 1 is the nomination in the first stage). Thus, the individual with more nominations will be considered more important than the contacts with only a few nominations.  The process is repeated till the growth of every individual is a constant.  I've attached the CNS code (which works for both connected and disconnected components)  Reference:-   Dynamical systems to define centrality in social networks by Poulin, Boily and Masse

Fast Algorithm for Finding Community Structure (migrated from Trac #245)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/245 Reported 2009-06-17 by trac user dcurtis, assigned to @chebee7i.  Here is a version of the algorithm from "Finding community structure in very large networks" by Aaron Clauset, M.E.J. Newman, and Cristopher Moore.  I think there are some things I could probably do better but the algorithm is pretty intensive.  If there was a maxheapq structure in Python it might save some time.  Any improvements I'd love to see.  It's not simple, consult the paper if you're curious why I did what I did.  One thing that I do that's somewhat crazyish is that I am building a dendrogram of the process.  Thus, each node is actually a tuple containing what are supposed to be communities.  In the end you'd have a single root node that is all communities as one.  The authors do provide a version of this written in C but of course they have lots of fun stuff to do because they don't have the Python datastructures. However, theirs runs faster.  With that said, I did test my algorithm and it gives identical results.

Hi all,  First of all - thanks a lot for NetworkX ! It is something I was looking for: easy to use, flexible and powerful.   I would like to contribute to the project.

To make the visualization nicer and easier to digest, the path corners are rounded with the help of quadratic and cube Bezier curves. Moreover, if two or more paths traverse the same edge, they are automatically shifted to make them all visible.   I attach the module and two figures generated with it. Looking forward to your comments!  qrancik

Consider views for graphs (migrated from Trac #338)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/338 Reported 2010-04-14 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  It would be nice to have a fast way to process parts of a graph. A view could be faster than creating the induced subgraph because it might not have to create the whole graph structure. Let's see if that is really true.

Add Global Reaching Centrality as measure of hierarchy (migrated from Trac #712)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/712 Reported 2012-04-05 by @conradlee, assigned to @conradlee.  Currently networkx implements one measure to measure how 'hierarchical' the structure of a directed graph is, located at networkx.hierarchy.flow_hierarchy.  Here I suggest another measure called "Global Reaching Centrality" suggested in the paper ''' @article{mones2012hierarchy,   title={Hierarchy measure for complex networks},   author={Mones, E. and Vicsek, L. and Vicsek, T.},   journal={Arxiv preprint arXiv:1202.0191},   year={2012} } '''  I think the appropriate location for this measure is in networkx.hierarchy  This measure is defined for unweighted directed graphs, weighted directed graphs, and unweighted undirected graphs.  I will at least implement the measure for both weighted and unweighted directed graphs.  I plan to submit this implementation as a pull request on the github repository.

speed up for simple_cycles using components (migrated from Trac #613)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/613 Reported 2011-08-05 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  On the discussion list, Kevin Greene said (7/22/2011):  I'm currently working on processing large graphs representing object  relations in a program.   One aspect I'm interested in is the number of cycles, and how many  nodes are present in cycles.   However, the standard nx.simple_cycles() takes a very long time on my  graphs (multiple days).   But, if I create the strongly connected components, then iterate over  all of the components, generating the cycles from them, the algorithm  is significantly faster. The 46,000 node graph that takes multiple  days with nx.simple_cycles takes about 5 minutes with my method.   I think the reason is in the simple_cycles method:  '''     ordering=dict(zip(G,range(len(G))))      for s in ordering:          # Build the subgraph induced by s and following nodes in the ordering          subgraph = G.subgraph(node for node in G                                if ordering[node] >= ordering[s])          # Find the strongly connected component in the subgraph          # that contains the least node according to the ordering          strongcomp = nx.strongly_connected_components(subgraph)  ''' It seems to me that this is generating the strongly connected  components far too often, which can be costly in a large graph.   Also, because of the nature of strongly connected components, no  simple cycle should exist between two distinct components. So, if  instead of   '''nx.simple_cycles(G) '''  I do  ''' s_components = nx.strongly_connected_components(G)  cycles = []  for s_component in s_components:      if len(s_component) == 1:          continue      else:          for cycle in nx.simple_cycles(component):              cycles.append(cycle)  ''' Is there any flaw in this? It is also much faster for the graphs I am  working on, and seems like it would be faster in general, for any  graph with at least a few strongly connected components.

k-components approximation (migrated from Trac #589)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/589 Reported 2011-07-07 by @jtorrents, assigned to @jtorrents.  New version of the algorithm. To run it you'll need the code for vertex connectivity approximation #538, the antigraph data structure #608. For accuracy tests you will also need the flow based connectivity code #625   A k-component is a maximal subgraph that cannot be disconnected removing less than k nodes (along with their incident edges). By Merger's theorem, this is  equivalent to a maximal subgraph in which all pairs of nodes are connected  by at least k node-independent paths which each run entirely within the  subgraph. Note that a k-component must be a subset of a (k-1)-component or be a (k-1)-component itself. Thus, they have an inherent hiearchical structure. Components of level k can overlap in k-1 nodes.  Following White and Harary (2001) and Moody and White (2003), the cohesive  structure of a network can be conceptualized as increasingly cohesive groups  nested inside each other. Those groups can be operacionalized as the  k-components of the network. A common structural pattern in large networks is  an hierarchical nesting of increasingly cohesive groups at low connectivity  levels and non-overlapping highly cohesive groups at higher connectivity levels.   Those highly cohesive groups play a key role in the diffusion of the  consequences of social interactions among actors in networks. It is usually  assumed that the transmission through the network of knowledge, influence  and resources generated by social interactions is limited to people 2 or 3  steps away from the initiator of such interactions. However, strongly cohesive  subsets of nodes allow repetition of information and reinforcement of influence  because they are characterized by multiple independent pathways that  compensate the decay effects of the transmission of knowledge,  influence and resources.  An exact solution for the computation of the complete k-component structure  (Moody & White, 2003) is impractical for large networks. This approximation  is based on the proposal of White and Newman (2001) of a fast approximation for finding node independent paths (implemented in #538). It allows us to  compute the approximate k-component structure for moderately large networks,  in a reasonable time frame.  The algorithm consists in 6 steps: 1. k-core computation (time O(E)): Compute the core number for each node. A k-core is a maximal subgraph that contains nodes of degree k or more. The core number of a node is the largest value k of a k-core containing that node. This is a baseline for k-components because \kappa(G) <= \lambda(G) <= \delta(G) 2. bicomponents computation (time O(V+E)): Compute the biconnected components of the graph. (k>2)-components are a subset of (or are themselves also) a bicomponent. Besides, the exact computation is faster than the approximation because usually bicomponents are quite large. Thus we start computing the approximation for k=3. (same for tricomponents but it is not implemented in NetworkX yet) 3. for each k from 3 to the maximum core number of a node of the graph we repeat the following steps: 4. For each bicomponent we create a subgraph with all nodes with core level = k. Compute the connected component of the k-core sugraph (note that the k-core could be disconnected) and then compute the approximation for vertex connectivity (proposed by White and Newman (2001)) between all pairs of nodes. Implemented in ticket #538.  5. Build an auxiliary graph with all nodes in the subgraph analyzed and edges between two nodes if the local vertex connectivity (ie number of node independent paths between them) is greater or equal than the level k of the main for loop. Note: we actually use a complement graph data structure to save memory because usually a big part of the k-core is actually a k-component. 6. Each connected component of the auxiliary graph is a candidate to be a k-component. But we need to do a final check: we create the induced subgraph of candidate nodes from the input graph and discard any node that, in this induced subgraph, has core number less than k. The remaining nodes are assumed to be a k-component.  References  ``` White, Douglas R., and Mark Newman. 2001  A Fast Algorithm for Node-Independent Paths.

Add node independent paths functions (migrated from Trac #538)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/538 Reported 2011-04-10 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  Because of the new flow based connectivity functions (#625) I've changed the name for this module from '''node_independent_paths.py''' to '''connectivity_approx.py'''. I also added a new function '''global_vertex_connectivity_approx''' that uses the same logic than its flow based friend but using the White and Newman fast approximation to find node independent paths. For sparse networks, the approximation is two orders of magnitude faster. I also removed functions for single source node independent paths and all pairs node independent paths because I think that this module will be more useful as a fast approximation to vertex connectivity.  Node independent paths or disjoint vertex paths are paths between two nodes that share no nodes in common other than their starting and ending nodes. The attached implementation finds node independents paths between two nodes by computing their shortest path using BFS, marking the nodes of the path found as 'used' and then searching other shortest paths excluding the nodes marked as used until no more paths exist.

Reimplement graphml to use SAX (and not build XML documents in memory) (migrated from Trac #455)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/455 Reported 2010-11-01 by @alexsdutton, assigned to @alexsdutton.  I've reimplemented the readwrite.graphml API to use a SAX content handler and xml.sax.utils.XMLGenerator instead of etree. It passes the tests (so could be assumed to be a functional replacement), but may need tidying.  We'd like to use graphml for serialization but it builds the XML document in memory, which is suboptimal for very large graphs. A SAX-based implementation also seems to be much quicker.  I've attached the patch.

The '''neighbors''' method could return edge data just like the '''edges''' method  does. This would allow simpler code when iterating over the adjacency list of a node.  See #574 for discussion and examples.  '''G.neighbors(n, data=True)''' would return a dict keyed by neighbor node to the edge data dict connecting them.    '''G.neighbors_iter(n, data=True)''' would return an iterator of pairs (nbr,edgedata).   This is similar to G.edges(n, data=True) but that iterates through (n,nbr,edgedata).

Change methods to return iterators and retire _iter methods (migrated from Trac #581)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/581 Reported 2011-06-25 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  Graph class methods such as '''neighbors''', '''degree''', and '''edges''' return lists or dicts when it seems cleaner and more efficient to return iterators.    Currently these methods have cousin methods like '''edges_iter''' that do return iterators..  We should consider removing the '''_iter''' methods and making the others return iterators by design.  Then if the user needs a list of dict they can use e.g. '''list(G.edges())'''  Making the default behavior an iterator encourages efficiency.  Most methods would generate pairs (node, value) that could be used to construct a dict.  It might also be useful to be able to generate just the values.  Some methods like '''G.nodes()}} would naturally just generate single values.

Speeding up double edge swap (migrated from Trac #328)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/328 Reported 2010-03-21 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  I've come across some cases where it is relatively rare for a network to remain connected after an edge swap.  For the current code it will check if the entire network is still connected, which is slow.  If successful, then it will do two swaps before checking if the entire network is still connected, at which point if there is a failure it will undo both swaps and start over.  There is a faster test when only one edge swap has been done.  The disadvantage of testing each time is that in many cases the vast majority of swaps leave a connected network, and so it may be faster to do many swaps and then use the slower test.  The existing code makes this assumption, and tries to estimate the optimal number of swaps by dynamically increasing the number as there are more successes and halving the number if there is a failure.  I have created a modified code.  If the 'optimal' number of swaps appears to be small (at present <3), then it will simply check after each swap if the network is still connected.  If the number gets larger it will switch to checking only after many swaps.  I believe this code will always be faster than the pre-existing code.    However, it may be able to make it faster by changing the cutoff between the two methods to a larger value.  In fact, if we test the cpu time each time it tests whether the network is still connected, we can get a good idea of which method is faster.  If the slower test takes 10 times as long, then the window should be a bit larger than 10 before we switch to that test.  I haven't tried to implement that but it would probably be a significant speed up and ensure that the approach is working well for all sorts of different network types.

Approximation algorithms in NetworkX (migrated from Trac #700)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/700 Reported 2012-02-29 by @quattro, assigned to @hagberg.  Approximation algorithms for NP-Hard graph/network problems are quite useful in practice. I have a small library of approximation algorithms that would be better put to use in NetworkX rather than a separate library. The current code is located here [https://bitbucket.org/nmancuso/apxa]. The code is currently supported with tests and documentation. Some of the shorter algorithms can easily be merged into NetworkX, while a few rely on a custom priority queue class that might need more input from developers.  But before I begin creating tickets for merging in the code, how would the developers like it structured? Should there be a separate module (like bipartite) or should it coincide with the regular algorithms list? For example, I have a greedy maximal matching algorithm that serves as a basis for many 2-OPT algorithms. That could go side-by-side with the maximum matching function.

Better documentation for handling weighted edges by shortest path algorithms (migrated from Trac #509)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/509 Reported 2011-02-16 by mkuhnert, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi everybody,  during working with centralities based on shortest paths algorithms (closeness centrality, betweenness centrality) for weighted networks, I learned that the shortest path algorithms for weighted network (''single_source_dijkstra_path_length'' and ''single_source_dijkstra_path_basic'') use as length for an edge per default the weight of the edge. This is for me, and probably for others, not intuitive and moreover only documented in ''single_source_dijkstra'', which is called by ''single_source_dijkstra_path_length''.   My suggestion is to add ''Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.'' or something similar to the docstring of both centrality functions and to ''single_source_dijkstra_path_length'' and ''single_source_dijkstra_path_basic'', respectively.   Another nice feature would be to include the argument ''weight=weight'' to both centrality functions and to ''single_source_dijkstra'', so that instead of the edge weight another distance measure can be assigned to edges. This has already been implemented in ''single_source_dijkstra_path_length''.   Thanks a lot  Marie-Therese

Add a label check when testing for isomorphism (graph mining) (migrated from Trac #566)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/566 Reported 2011-06-06 by trac user Mikk, assigned to @chebee7i.  It may be nice if all the VF2 isomorphisms implementations consider a special attribute of the nodes and the edges as a label to test isomorphism. This is the basis of many graph mining algorithms such as gSpan, Gaston, GERM and others. Alternatively you may consider to add one of this algorithm to the library, but I think is more important to add the label check feature because, if you do so, you have it available also for multigraphs, and none of the known algorithms works with multigraphs.  An example. Currently the following code returns two (the mappings between g1 and g2). It should not, since in g2 one label is different (it's 3 and should be 2). ''' g1 = nx.MultiGraph() g1.add_nodes_from([1,2,3]) g1.add_edges_from([(1,2,{'dimension': 1}), (1,3,{'dimension': 1}), (2,3,{'dimension': 1}), (1,2,{'dimension': 2})]) g2 = nx.MultiGraph() g2.add_nodes_from([1,2]) g2.add_edges_from([(1,2,{'dimension': 1}), (1,2,{'dimension': 3})]) print len(list(nx.WeightedMultiGraphMatcher(g1, g2).subgraph_isomorphisms_iter())) '''

track node and edge orders (migrated from Trac #445)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/445 Reported 2010-10-03 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.  The user can always do this, but is there any interest in storing the node/edge addition order into NetworkX?  For example, each graph class could have an attribute: '''    G._node_order    G._edge_order ''' These attributes would be lists of the node/edge attribute dictionaries, in the order that they were added to the graph instance. Since we're not copying the attribute dictionaries, it seems like this would have a fairly small footprint.  So each graph would have something like: '''    G._nodeIndex    G._edgeIndex ''' which are integers storing the total number of nodes/edges that have ever been put into the graph.  Note: this is not the same as the total number of nodes/edges currently in the graph (since the user might delete nodes/edges).  As each node/edge is added to the graph, we store its index in the attribute dictionary.  This provides for an easy lookup and way to mark the node/edge as deleted.  '''  > > > G = nx.Graph() > > > G.add_edge(0,1) > > > G[0][1] > > > {'index': 0} > > > G.nodes[0] > > > {'index': 0} > > > G.nodes[1] > > > {'index': 1} > > > G._node_index > > > 2 > > > G._edge_index > > > 1 > > > G._node_order > > > [{'index': 0}, {'index': 1}] > > > G._edge_order > > > [{'index': 0}] > > > G.add_edge(0, 2) > > > G.remove_node(1) > > > G._node_order > > > [{'index': 0}, None, {'index': 2}] > > > G._edge_order > > > [{'index': 1}] > > > '''  So when an node/edge is deleted, its 'index' attribute is used to mark the location in _node_order (or _edge_order) to have the value of `None`.  Then, we could provide some methods like: ''' def node_order(self):     return [n for n in self._node_order if n is not None] ''' and similarly for edge_order.  Not sure if this is a good way to implement it, but I thought the feature might seem useful. Please comment!

Mistake in computation of average neighbor degree for directed networks (migrated from Trac #639)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/639 Reported 2011-09-27 by Oleguer Sagarra <oleguer.sagarra, assigned to @hagberg.  There is a problem in the algorithm to compute the negihbor degree (and average neighbor degree) for directed networks. The thing is that as networkx is based on a dict of dicts one may follow the neighbors of a node "forward" but not "backwards", meaning that with the functions such as G.in_degree(G[n]) one lists the incoming degree of the neighbors of the node "n", neighbors meaning destination of directed edges starting at node n. For all this, the normalization factor used is wrong. Additionally, it has some bugs with division over zero values.  These features need to be better redefined for various reasons:  a) With directed networks one can compute 4 types of features divided into two subgroups:        a.1) For the neighbors of a node n (by neighbors meaning ending points of directed edges starting at node n) one can compute the Incoming our outgoing degree of a node.        a.2) For all predecessors of node n (meaning all sources of edges finishing in node n) one can compute the very same thing.  b) Additionally, accounting for the average connectivity (or average neighbor degree as a function of degree of a node) things get messy, because then one may compute 8 different features divided into two groups, providing different information:         b.1) Consider all the neighbors (defined earlier) of node n. Consider all the nodes n in the net. For each node n compute the (in-degree, out-degree) of their neighbors, then average over all n nodes of (in-degree, out-degree) 'k'.        b.2) The same for predecessors of degree n.  The current code can be adapted to do so, using the function G.reverse() to overcome the difficulty in quickly computing the predecessors of a node while keeping the code structure. But the documentation need to be rewritten and the normalization of the averages redone.  Reference :  Serrano, M.A., Maguitman, A., Boguna, M., Fortunato, S. & Vespignani, A.

Improve performance of Graph.size() and Graph.number_of_edges() by caching the number of edges, looping over edges not nodes (migrated from Trac #494)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/494 Reported 2011-01-27 by unknown, assigned to @hagberg.  Calls to `Graph.size()` and `Graph.number_of_edges()` take far too long for graphs with non-trivial numbers of edges. The problem stems from `Graph.size()` looping over every node in the graph and summing the degree for that node. (As `Graph.number_of_edges()` calls `Graph.size()` when no arguments are provided, it follows that method suffers the same issue.)  The `Graph` instance ought to cache the number of edges present, simply by creating a `Graph._number_of_edges` attribute, set to `0` in `__init__`, then incrementing and decrementing this count for calls to `add_edge()` and `remove_edge()` (and their collective `nbunch` brethren) respectively. Then, when the user calls `size()` or `number_of_edges()`, simply `return self._number_of_edges` and be done with it.  Note that even if the user does provide the `weighted=True` parameter to `Graph.size()`, it still runs twice as long as it should because it loops over the nodes instead of the edges.

Add flow based connectivity and cutsets functions (migrated from Trac #625)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/625 Reported 2011-08-21 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  All these functions are build around Loïc's nice implementation of the Ford and Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow. They should work for both directed and undirected graphs. Connectivity functions are well documented in the literature (see references and docstrings) and use the current implementation of maxflow.py. The directed case is not covered in deep in the references. The adaptation is straightforward, but it should be reviewed.  The (vertex and edge) cutset functions need a modification of the ford_fulkerson function: to compute the cutset we need the residual network after finding the maximum flow. The patch '''maxflow_cutset.patch''' adds an auxiliary function that computes the cutset, a parameter to the ford_fulkerson function to optionally return the cutset instead of the flow_dict and a new function '''cut_set''' that returns only the cutset. I wasn't able to find a proper reference for the algorithm for computing the cutset from the residual network,  but it is nicely explained in (3, the part with the diagrams with yellow and blue nodes).  Global minimim cutset functions are analog to connectivity functions, so they share a lot of code. I'm not sure of the best way to integrate them, an alternative approach would be to compute always the cutset and, for connectivity functions, return its length.   Regarding names (which is always hard), I've used '''global_vertex_connectivity''' for connectivity of the whole graph and '''vertex_connectivity''' for local st connectivity. But in the case of cuts I've used '''minimum_vertex_cutset''' for a global minimum cut and '''minimum_st_vertex_cutset''' for local st minimum cuts. So, the names for cutset are ugly and long and inconsistent with connectivity ones. Suggestions are very welcome.  References  (1) Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian.

Feedback on adding Omnigraffle read support (migrated from Trac #578)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/578 Reported 2011-06-23 by @sk2, assigned to @hagberg.  Hello,  I have been looking at OmniGraffle support in NetworkX.  NetworkX does not currently support reading of graphs drawn in OmniGraffle. OmniGraffle only exports to image formats. There have been some requests in their forums to export to a graph based format (dot etc) but they have not yet been implemented.  There is a Python project - graffle2svg - which converts an Omnigraffle document into an SVG document. We could adapt this - the document reading part - for NetworkX.  I emailed the author about adapting the code for use in NetworkX, and he was ok with this.  Is something that would be of interest? Most of the heavy lifting is done in http://code.google.com/p/graffle2svg/source/browse/trunk/graffle2svg/main.py We can discard the graphics information, we only need the part that pushes the Graffle document into a Python data structure.  This does not export back to Graffle format, however OmniGraffle can read graphviz dot files, so I think this is an acceptable work around.  The biggest hurdle I see is that they use xml minidom, whereas NetworkX uses ElementTree. Any comments on this? Should I modify it to use ET?  Any feedback is welcomed.  Cheers Simon

Persistent graph storage (migrated from Trac #224)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/224 Reported 2009-02-07 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  The mailing list discussion at http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss/browse_thread/thread/edc1b0ad6728243e# suggested some ideas for persistent storage of NetworkX graphs.  Attached is an example of how to do this using shelve. Use it like this: '''  > > > G=PersistentGraph(file='graph.db') > > > G.add_edge('a','b') > > > del G  # closes file graph.db > > > G=PersistentGraph(file='graph.db')  > > > print G.edges() > > > [('b', 'a')] > > > '''  This version works with both writeback=True and writeback=False for the shelve. See http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/node328.html for an example of the difference. For writeback=True only a very simple modification of the Graph() class code is necssary to use a shelve instead of dict as the underlying data structure. For writeback=False a few methods need to be changed to handle the persistence correctly.    There is also test (run with nosetests -v) to demonstrate that it at least passes the "smoke test".    Some drawbacks to this approach:  Only the adjacency structure is stored (as a shelve dict-of-dicts) -  no metadata about the graph (e.g graph type).   It is obviously slower.  I didn't do any benchmarks.   Only strings are allowed as shelve keys. So nodes must be strings.  If this has decent performance it may be useful to incorporate into NetworkX.  Either as an option in the existing graph classes  or as as separate graph classes.

Inheriting from dict can potentially create a more natural Python API for Graph().  Using such a class would allow saying G[u][v]=data (currently wrong, causes inconsistent internal data) to create a new edge and del G[u][v] to remove an edge (also currently creates inconsistent internal data structure).  Attached is a pure Python Graph() reference class based on inheriting from dict that implements the NetworkX 0.99 API.  It is  substantially slower (5-10 times) than NetworkX Graph().  A C language dict-of-dicts base class that implements this could improve performance.

Perhaps it might be improved by a little C code to do the File I/O and some cache optimization?

Matplotlib.pylab drawing (migrated from Trac #743)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/743 Reported 2012-07-12 by jjkoehler9, assigned to unknown.  Hi all,  I posted to the matplotlib users list concerning issues drawing to two figures (at different times) in wxPython. After some investigation the problem seemed to rest with networkx's integration with matplotlib.pylab. The trouble was with getting the correct figure. Someone in the discussion opened up the source code and suggested the possible cause. In the meantime, there is a workaround but he suggested it might be good to report this deficiency to you guys.  Here is the link to the discussion:  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAAXu2r%3DQ8M3z0HK_u7cL9%2BNPoCC%2B6fJWdn0LQVMoSyq%2BA-DT8Q%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=matplotlib-users  The fourth post is the most relevant.

It would be convenient to be able to directly get an edge attribute through the API.

An nbunch that is not a node or a sequence of nodes gives an unclear error (migrated from Trac #41)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/41 Reported 2006-05-19 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  In most every routine that uses nbunch, an exception is thrown when nbunch is not a node and also not a sequence.   The resulting "TypeError, iteration over non-sequence"  message can be confusing because the location of the error is sometimes a few lines below the for-loop over nbunch.  This does not occur for edges_iter and its cousins which are set up  to ignore the exception.  Proposal:   Reduce the nbunch handling code to a few lines which are isolated from the rest of the routine and the same for all routines using nbunch. I think the following is a possibility: ''' if nbunch is None:  # include all nodes     nbunch=self.nodes_iter(): elif nbunch in self:  # a single node in the graph     nbunch=[nbunch] else:            # try making a list of ndes from the nbunch sequence     try:          nbunch=[ n for n in nbunch if n in self ]     except TypeError, "iteration over non-sequence":          raise NetworkXError, "nbunch is not a node or a sequence of nodes." '''  What do you think?  Also, should edges and family still return empty lists?

Optionally return residual graph and maybe also the cut in ford_fulkerson (migrated from Trac #710)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/710 Reported 2012-03-30 by @jtorrents, assigned to @loicseguin.  Given that ford_fulkerson requires a fair amount of time to compute, and that its result and byproducts can be used for many things, I think that we should find a way to allow users to obtain whatever they want without forcing them to run ford_fulkerson more than once, or to perform additional computations for common stuff, such as obtaining the cut associated to a maximum flow.  See the discussion of ticket #625 (add flow based connectivity and cuts) for context and for a use case of the residual network. See also the patches to maxflow.py attached to that ticket (1) for two different approaches, the first adds a function to maxflow.py to compute the cut, the second only adds an option to optionally return the residual graph instead of the flow_dict.   I'm not sure which is the best approach. Also, we should consider that returning too many things from a single function can be confusing.

Eccentricity returns a single value for graphs with single node. (migrated from Trac #738)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/738 Reported 2012-07-05 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  The eccentricity function allows a node to be specified and returns the value of the eccentricity for that node if provided.  That is a worthwhile feature.  But the logic of deciding whether the node has been specified does not handle the case of a graph with a single node.    We should change the logic to return the eccentricity value when a node has been specified rather than when there is a single node in the result of computing the eccentricity.

convert.to_scipy_sparse_matrix does not respect nodelist ordering (migrated from Trac #737)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/737 Reported 2012-06-30 by dimatura, assigned to @hagberg.  The `to_scipy_sparse_matrix` function in the development version (and in Networkx 1.7rc1) does not respect the ordering of nodes in `nodelist` nor does it use the ordering in `G.nodes()` if `nodelist` is not given.  The problem is in the line  ''' index = dict(zip(set(nodelist),range(nlen))) ''' There is no reason to expect the `set()` function will preserve the ordering of nodes in nodelist.   This is easily fixed by separately checking for duplicate nodes, as in the attached diff.  As a side note, the comments in the function are outdated, since this version uses COO representation, not LIL (as in 1.6, which works fine by the way).

I think there is a mistake in the floyd_warshall_numpy function, because it does not properly work with non-symmetric adjacency matrices. I think in https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/browser/networkx/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/dense.py   line 61 should be changed by the following one:  A = np.minimum(A, A[i,:] + A[:,i])  and then line 60 can be removed. I've tested this change with several graphs, and now it provides the same results than the floyd_warshall function.

Copy of data dictionary created when adding edges with given data (migrated from Trac #723)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/723 Reported 2012-05-09 by linus.junden, assigned to @hagberg.  When using e.g. add_edges_from, and I think it applies to adding nodes as well, the original dictionary given is copied, not saved by reference. See attached example code.  I realized this when trying out an algorithm based on removing edges, doing some analysis on the network, and then adding the edges again. For now I use infinite weight instead, gives the same result for me.  The problem is in the following lines in graph.py, under add_edges_from:  datadict=self.adj[u].get(v,{}) #here is the problem datadict.update(attr_dict) datadict.update(dd)  instead of using the data dictionary (dd) directly a new dictionary is created and then updated with the content of dd.

Add legend feature to draw_network_xxx (migrated from Trac #708)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/708 Reported 2012-03-27 by ignaciobermudez, assigned to unknown.  There is no feature to draw node or edge legends in 'draw_networkx_nodes' and 'draw_networkx_nodes'.  It can be easily implemented by adding the feature 'label' to both definitions of 'nx_pylab'. As default behavior do not show labels, otherwise when calling legends on the pyplot it put a label to each collection. it's done as follows:  ``` label='__nolabel__', #As default, no legend.. ```  and in the calls to scatter nodes:  382     node_collection=ax.scatter(xy[:,0], xy[:,1],  383                                s=node_size,  ...  390       ---->                    label=label,  391                                linewidths=linewidths)  In this way labels can be shown by calling the method pyplot.legends().

PageRank errors on empty graph (migrated from Trac #702)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/702 Reported 2012-03-08 by @conradlee, assigned to @hagberg.  When any of NetworkX's PageRank implementations are run on a graph which contains no nodes or edges, an error is raised (A ZeroDivisionError for the numpy and python implementations, a ValueError for the scipy implementation).  While it may seem silly to run PageRank on an empty graph, in some cases one might be running a program on a large set of unknown graphs, some of which are empty and some of which are not.  Such a program should not need to handle NetworkX errors when running measures on empty networkx graphs.  I'm not sure how to best deal with empty graphs, but probably returning an empty dictionary is the right thing to do.

2*OPT approximation for min weighted vertex cover (migrated from Trac #701)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/701 Reported 2012-02-29 by @quattro, assigned to @hagberg.  While #700 is being discussed, I figured I can start adding the simplest approximation algorithms that have no real dependencies. Here is the code to compute the Min Weighted Vertex Cover ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover]) of a simple graph in time O(V + E). In the worst case it will output a cover that has twice the weight of OPT. This can be seen from simple local ratio arguments (we "pay" at most twice, per edge).

Improve bipartite documentation (migrated from Trac #699)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/699 Reported 2012-02-26 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  There have been some questions at the mailing list about how to work with bipartite networks using NetworkX (1,2). The patch attached: 1. Expands main bipartite module documentation addressing the doubts raised in the mailing list. Among other things, it clearly states the convention of using the node attribute "bipartite" to identify the two node sets, and shows with examples how to get the two containers with each node set. 2. Shortens the first sentence of bipartite projection functions, so they fit nicely in the generated html at algorithms.bipartite.html 3. It also adds me as author (along with Aric) of the projection.py file in the bipartite package. See #532 for the development history of that file.

Graphml writer does not support numpy types (migrated from Trac #696)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/696 Reported 2012-02-25 by @conradlee, assigned to @hagberg.  Many networkx functions return values in numpy types, such as pagerank_numpy.  If these values are assigned as node attributes, then the graph can no longer be exported to graphml because an error is raised.  Even worse, the error suggests the wrong problem:  NetworkXError: GraphML writer does not support dict types as data values.  This error should say that it does not support whatever type is is trying to write (it should not be hard coded to say that it doesn't support dict type).  So I suggest two changes: adding support for numpy types in the graphml writer, and changing this error message to correctly indicate the type that is unsupported.  To support numpy types, one simply needs to add some tuples to the list called "types" that is a member of the GraphML class in the file readwrite/graphml.py

relabel_nodes does not handle self-referencing node when copy=False (migrated from Trac #674)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/674 Reported 2012-01-11 by mluiten, assigned to @hagberg.  When calling relabel_nodes with copy=False, and the graph contains one or more nodes that have edges to themselves, the old label is re-added, without attributes or edges.  I think this happens because in relabel.py:120 and onwards, the self-referencing edges are added to new_edges with the old label, and when add_edges_from is called on line 127, the node is added to the graph again.  What remains is the real node with attributes and edges, and a dummy node with no attributes, edges and the old label.  I fixed this locally by adding a check if the edge is self-referencing and if so, replacing it with the new label.  relabel.py, line 121 to 125 '''#!python             new_edges=[(new,old == target and new or target,data) for (_,target,data)                        in G.edges(old,data=True)]             if directed:                 new_edges+=[(old == source and new or source,new,data) for (source,_,data)                        in G.in_edges(old,data=True)] '''  A simple test case: '''#!python from networkx import DiGraph, relabel_nodes  graph = DiGraph() graph.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3]) graph.add_edges_from([(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)])  relabel_nodes(graph, {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three'}, copy=False)  assert 1 not in graph '''

Serialization error of node attribute "id" in write_gexf (migrated from Trac #673)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/673 Reported 2012-01-06 by Menno Luiten <mluiten, assigned to @hagberg.  While debugging for bug #672, I found that write_gexf treats the node attribute called "id" specially (as documented it is placed as attribute "id" on every <node> instead of an attribute in <attributes>), but raises a TypeError from ElementTree (could not serialize type int) when using an integer as the 'id'. Manually converting to a string resolved the issue. It might be worthwhile to check for integers and convert them to strings in write_gexf (and other write functions which might behave the same way).

There used to be an option with the various dfs versions of code to say 'reverse_graph=True'.  I've got a directed graph, and I want to identify the in-component of a node.  The old code I have now breaks.  Is there any function in the current networkx version that will find the in component of a node?  If not, can I suggest reintroducing it?  thanks, Joel

networkx.generators.directed.scale_free_graph (migrated from Trac #664)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/664 Reported 2011-12-12 by a.pilaszkiewicz, assigned to @hagberg.  function scale_free_graph._choose_node is not consistent with Reference [1]:  In paper it is stated: Pr(v=vi) = (deg_out(vi) + delta_out)/(t+delta_out_n(t) Pr(v=vi) = (deg_in(vi) + delta_in)/(t+delta_in_n(t) where: t    --- number of edges at time t n(t) --- number of vertices at time t  In function  _choose_node as distribution are passed G.out_degree() and G.in_degree() which are used as distribution argument and psum is calculated: psum=float(sum(distribution.values()))+float(delta)*len(distribution)  so in reality in _choose_node, psum is calculated with respect to number of outgoing edges or incoming edges, not total number of edges.

dfs_preorder etc should accept multiple sources (migrated from Trac #661)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/661 Reported 2011-12-07 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  I have a command in my code that I expected to work:    dfs_preorder_nodes(EPN,source=range(IC)) Ultimately this calls    dfs_labeled_edges(G,source=None) and the code there is set up to run with a list of sources, but if source != None, then it uses nodes=[source] and if source==None, it uses nodes=G.  So it only actually uses a list if source==None.  It should be a simple change to use nodes=[source] if source is just a node, otherwise it should use nodes=source if source is a list.  The potential pitfall I see is if the graph happens to have lists as nodes.  Particularly if the list [a,b] is a node and 'a' and 'b' are also both nodes.  I'm not sure how to handle this most elegantly, or I'd write the code myself.  For my purposes, I've just removed the command that creates a list containing source.  It appears to run find then if I send it a list.

current flow betweenness subset functionality (migrated from Trac #648)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/648 Reported 2011-11-02 by t.r.etherington, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi, in moving from version 1.4 to 1.5 the ability to calculate current flow on a subset of source and target  nodes (the "current_flow_betweenness_centrality_subset" function) has gone.  While I can continue to use version 1.4, I would very much like to make use of the new current flow functionality in version 1.5 (the availability of different solvers, and the approximation function).  Therefore I was hoping to suggest that the ability to define subsets could be reintroduced at some point.  Cheers,  Tom

parsing matplotlib version number in nx_pylab (migrated from Trac #647)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/647 Reported 2011-10-26 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  The github version of matplotlib returns the version as something like:  1.2.x which doesn't work with our current code in nx_pylab.py.  The reason we check the matplotlib version is to ensure it is greater than 0.87.7.  We can put a simple fix in to handle the "x".  But maybe it is worth rewriting the code to disregard anything after the second "." in the version string.  We lose the ability to check of 0.87.6 versus 0.87.7, but if we make it 0.88 we will be excluding very few people and we won't have to worry about extra symbols added later to the matplotlib version string (assuming they are always in the third part of the string).  Thoughts?

random graph generated from previous graph doesn't keep nodes parameters (migrated from Trac #645)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/645 Reported 2011-10-19 by unknown, assigned to @hagberg.  Hello  When generating a random graph passing a current graph as a parameter:  g2 = networkx.generators.random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph(4, 2, g1)  where the initial g1 has nodes parameters such as:  g1[1]['weight'] = 9  g2 doesn't keep g1 as part of g2 - at least there is no node with weight = 9 in g2.  I assume passing g1 into g2 generation function is meant to keep g1 as an initial graph and then add n nodes to it... or did I got that wrong?   How to generate a random graph from an existing one - keeping the existing nodes and edges and their  properties in the newly generated graph? I.e. how to grow a graph randomly? where random here is meant for the newly added nodes and edges only rather than to the original ones.  Thank you.

add new decorator package to setup.py (migrated from Trac #631)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/631 Reported 2011-09-09 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  It is necessary to add the new package '''networkx.external.decorator''' to the list of packages in setup.py in order to get an usable fresh installation of NetworkX. Attached is a patch that adds the package, not sure if more changes are necessary.  By the way, I did some tests with pypy and it seems that the new decorator package works perfectly. There are still some errors and failures in the tests (mainly related to the fact that the '''micronumpy''' released with pypy only supports a small subset of numpy functionality) but I think that with a little work we can have a fully pypy compatible NetworkX soon.

networkx drawing with edge_color in hex (migrated from Trac #626)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/626 Reported 2011-08-24 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  If I use draw_networkx_nodes with   color = 'FF2000'  it works fine.  If I do the same with draw_networx_edges, it gives an error.  The error comes from this bit of nx_pylab:  ```     if len(edge_color)==1:         edge_colors = ( colorConverter.to_rgba(edge_color, alpha), )     else:         raise ValueError('edge_color must be a single color or list of exactly m colors where m is the number or edges') ```  The problem is that the length evaluates to the length of the string, which is 7.  A hack that works for me is to add  "or len(edge_color)==7" to the test.  But that's probably not the right solution.  It's not clear to me why all this testing is going on for edge_color since I don't see any of that for node_color.  So I wonder if this is some form of legacy code.  At any rate, ideally we should be able to give a hex argument.

In edge_betweenness_centrality(G,normalized= True,False)  when the option "normalized" is set to True the function should return -according to the refecence guide- betweenness values normalized by  2/(n-1)(n-2) where n  is the number of nodes in G,  but in fact it returns the absolute value normalized by 2/(e-1)(e-2) with e the number of nodes in G.  This normalization makes no sense and is not used in the literature. In fact the correct normalization should be 2/n(n-1) which is the the number of possible pairs of vertices.

Graphml attribute key should be int not integer (migrated from Trac #615)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/615 Reported 2011-08-10 by @sk2, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi, I am having problems opening Graphml files generated by NetworkX in external programs. I don't think the attribute exported by NetworkX correctly follows the Graphml spec for integer values:  ''' import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_node('a', attr=1) nx.write_graphml(G, "test.graphml") '''  ''' sk:zt sk2$ more test.graphml  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd">   <key attr.name="attr" attr.type="integer" for="node" id="d0" />   <graph edgedefault="undirected">     <node id="a">       <data key="d0">1</data>     </node>   </graph> </graphml> '''  The line   <key attr.name="attr" attr.type="integer" for="node" id="d0" /> should be    <key attr.name="attr" attr.type="int" for="node" id="d0" />  According to: http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0rc/graphml-attributes.xsd   <xs:restriction base="xs:NMTOKEN">       <xs:enumeration value="boolean"/>     <xs:enumeration value="int"/>     <xs:enumeration value="long"/>     <xs:enumeration value="float"/>     <xs:enumeration value="double"/>     <xs:enumeration value="string"/>   /xs:restriction  I beleive the problem is in the '''     types=((str,"yfiles"),(str,"string"), (unicode,"string"),            (int,"int"), (int,"integer"), (float,"float"), (float,"double"),            (bool, "boolean")) ''' bit of graphml.py where we have (int,"int"), (int,"integer") - why is this twice?

Order of nodes in expected_degree_graph() doesn't match order of input weights (migrated from Trac #612)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/612 Reported 2011-08-04 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  Since the weights are sorted (reverse) in the expected_degree_graph() algorithm the node id's don't match the weight order.   This is easily fixed by creating a mapping to the weight order.

Failed to retrieve attributes of the nodes, edges and a graph to be displayed with Graphviz utility (migrated from Trac #610)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/610 Reported 2011-07-28 by al_boi22, assigned to @hagberg.  Dear team,   I used the NetworkX package to simulate a network of the applications (Thank you for the nice package!). I found an issue, when I tried to display the graph and the attributes of the nodes and edges with Graphviz package.  Technically, it does not matter what package I used for visualization, because you can see the bug if you build a graph, add some attributes to the graph, nodes, edges and use 'write_dot' function to save the graph data in a readable format. I was not able to see any attributes, which I added earlier.  This bug is related to the following lines in 'to_pydot(...) function of 'networkx-1.5\networkx\drawing\nx_pydot.py' file:  ''' try:         #P.obj_dict['attributes'].update(N.graph.get('graph',{}))         P.obj_dict['attributes'].update(getattr(N,'graph',{}))     except:         pass  ``` try:     #P.obj_dict['nodes']['node'][0]['attributes'].update(N.graph.get('node',{}))     P.obj_dict['nodes']['node'][0]['attributes'].update(getattr(N,'node',{})) except:     pass  try:     #P.obj_dict['nodes']['edge'][0]['attributes'].update(N.graph.get('edge',{}))     P.obj_dict['nodes']['edge'][0]['attributes'].update(getattr(N,'edge',{})) except:     pass ```  '''  The commented lines are the ones, presented in the current version of the code. The following lines fix this bug. I believe, the original code was trying to retrieve the attributes of the attributes with the same name (for example, it was trying to find a "graph" attribute in the list of the "N.graph" attributes.  The updated version of the code works as expected.  Please, shoot me a line if you decide to update the code and move it to "production" version. I would like other developers to get the updated version of the code from your site.  Sincerely,  Alex.

Hi all,  I post a code as follows. In the code, I would like to find the connected components in a given graph, and then create an attribute called 'maxdegree'  for each subgraph returned from nx.connected_component_subgraphs(). The 'maxdegree' is the maximum degree of vertices in each subgraph. But what I got by running the code is wrong.   The graph's edgelist file is named "mstsample.edgelist".  1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7  Apparently, there are three components in the graph, [1,2,3] - maxdegree = 2 [4,5] - maxdegree = 1 [6,7] - maxdegree = 1  However, after I run the code I got all ones.  The test code is given here: import networkx as nx dataset = "mstsample" G = nx.read_edgelist(dataset+".edgelist") G = nx.convert_node_labels_to_integers(G,1,'sorted') subgraphlist = [] count = 0 for subg in nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G):     print("nodes " + str(subg.nodes()))     count = count + 1     nodeset = set(subg.nodes())     maxdegree = max(G.degree(x) for x in list(nodeset))     subg.graph['maxdegree'] = maxdegree     subgraphlist.append(subg) for i in range(0, len(subgraphlist)):     print(str(subgraphlist[i].graph['maxdegree']))  Please help me out.

Use of CSR sparse matrices in link_analysis (migrated from Trac #580)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/580 Reported 2011-06-24 by flaviovdf, assigned to @hagberg.  Both the: - networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank_scipy and - networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.hits_alg.hits_scipy  algorithms, could make use of scipy's CSR sparse matrix for runtime improvements. They are currently using LIL matrices.  From scipy's documentation: ##   http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.lil_matrix.html Disadvantages of the LIL format - arithmetic operations LIL + LIL are slow (consider CSR or CSC) - slow column slicing (consider CSC) - slow matrix vector products (consider CSR or CSC)  ---  http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html Advantages of the CSR format: - efficient arithmetic operations CSR + CSR, CSR \* CSR, etc. - efficient row slicing - fast matrix vector products  The advantages of CSR are exactly those needed for both algorithms. Conversion to CSR is trivial using the toscrc method. This can be done before the power iteration of both algorithms, that is:  ''' 351       i = 0 352       M = M.tocsr() 353       while i <= max_iter: '''  in pagerank_alg.py, and:  ''' 254       i = 0 255       M = M.tocsr() 256       A = A.tocsr() '''  in hits_alg.py. This is also fast according to: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html  I the use of the scipy methods are for very large graphs, where such changes are beneficial. In small graphs, users can use the numpy versions.

Hello- [[BR]] I am trying to model epidemics on networks with NetworkX, so I am hoping to look at how the network evolves with each time step. I am wondering if there is a way to do a screen-shot of the graph at each time step, or to save a graph at each time step ''without'' a new configuration being drawn each time. Right now, I am saving a copy of the graph at each time step, but it looks like it overlays all the previous graphs on top of each other in a different configuration each time so that the evolution of the epidemic (nodes of a different color) is impossible to follow.

I noticed that in calculating the average clustering coefficient of a network, nodes with only one neighbor are considered as having a clustering coefficient of 0. This is actually wrong, because the clustering coefficient is not defined for those nodes (because of division by zero).  They should be excluded in the networkx.average_clustering calculation.  The networkx.clustering function should return NA.

Deleting edges from reverse() graph affects original (migrated from Trac #567)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/567 Reported 2011-06-09 by me, assigned to @dschult.  I create a digraph R by calling reverse() on another digraph G. However if I call remove_edge() on R, it removes the corresponding edges from G as well.   According to the documentation, a new graph is returned by default when calling reverse() so removing edges on the reversed one should not affect the original.

A* (astar) algorithms depend on nodes being orderable. (migrated from Trac #562)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/562 Reported 2011-05-30 by unknown, assigned to @hagberg.  The A\* algorithms in networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar raise an unhandled exception when the nodes in the graph are not orderable (i.e. do no define node_1.**le**(node_2).) This is a bug, because orderability is not in general a requirement of NetworkX nodes.  The algorithms use a heap from the python heapq library as a priority queue for the sake of speed. This priority queue is the open list, used to hold all nodes that have been reached but not explored. Nodes are stored in this queue in the format (priority, node, cost to reach, parent); where priority is n + h; cost to reach is n; n is the cost to reach the node from the start along a given path; and h is the value of the heuristic estimating the distance from that node to the end. (Clarification: I say "along a given path" because old entries are not removed from the open list when better paths are found to reach them, the priority queue just ensures that they are ignored.)  The underlying heap regularly compares its elements, which are in this case the above 4-tuples. If the priorities (n + h) for two nodes are ever the same, the heap will attempt to compare the nodes themselves. If the nodes cannot be compared, this results in an unhandled TypeError exception and crashes the program.  I talked about this with Aric on the mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss/browse_thread/thread/a47b2df75d23944d) and he gave me this useful link (http://docs.python.org/library/heapq.html#priority-queue-implementation-notes). Thanks Aric.  I suggest instead of storing the 4-tuple, we store a 5-tuple in the format (priority, hash(node), node, cost to reach, parent). No two nodes in the graph can have the same hash, else they would already have collided. The addition of this extra element in the tuple will break any ties in priority, without relying on the nodes being directly comparable.   This solution is slightly cleaner than using a counter as suggested in the heapq doc.s.  This bug is present in 1.5rc1, and in the latest version of astar.py from the mercurial repo. I built the attached diff against that latest file; hopefully its correctly formatted--I made it with git on windows. I attached a file containing a single unittest demonstrating the failure.

Use iterators in python 3 idioms when possible (migrated from Trac #560)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/560 Reported 2011-05-29 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  A number of places in the code use the idiom: ''' for k,v in list( some_dict.items() ): ''' which was introduced by 2to3 when making the code work for python 3 as well as python 2.  In python 3, items() is a view on some_dict and not a list.  So  the translation to python 3 turns it into a list.  Most of the time (unless you want a copy of the items) you don't need/want the list--a view is just fine.  In those cases we should use some_dict.items() instead of list(some_dict.items())  Similarly for iter(some_dict.items()) when inside a for loop.

pagerank_scipy could take advantage of sparse matrix during normalization (migrated from Trac #554)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/554 Reported 2011-05-17 by chapman, assigned to @hagberg.  I am using a sparse version of query-dependent pagerank in my research.  I use networkx for graph manipulation and used the included implementation of pagerank_scipy as a starting point for my algorithm.  Curiously, I noticed the setup took longer than the convergence iterations and determined the cause.  Though the calculation takes advantage of sparsity, the normalization step does not.  This could be remedied by changing 3 lines of code in networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/pagerank_alg.py:  Current dense version: ''' 341     index=scipy.where(S != 0)[0] 342     for i in index: 343         M[i,:]*=1.0/S[i] '''  Improved sparse version: ''' 341     I, J, V = scipy.sparse.find( M ) 342     for index, i in enumerate( I ) : 343         M[i,J[index]] = V[index] / S[i] '''

Improved Dijkstra "from one to all" algorithms (migrated from Trac #541)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/541 Reported 2011-04-14 by ove.andersen.oa, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi. I've made an new version of the single_source_dijkstra algorithm from /networkx/algorithms/shortest_path/weighted.py  I needed an algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single source to all nodes, without the need for knowing the exact path traveled, which is done by using single_source_dijkstra_path_length. This algorithm do though only call the single_source_dijkstra algorithm, which also calculates, and returns, the exact path path from a single source to all other sources.  Two problems existed, for my purpose, with this algorithm. First of all, it is quite slow. I have to compute from source to all nodes from around 9,000 nodes. Second of all it uses a whole lot of memory. Due to some limitations, I had to run the solution on a 32 bit architecture, and with a graph with 363,634 nodes and 822,284 edges, the system easily runs out of memory.  A second need for me was to calculate a second weight while minimizing for one weight. In practice I needed to find the shortest path in a road network in terms of time spent, while I also had to calculate the length in meters of the fastest path.  Thus I modified the existing single_source_dijkstra algorithm for my needs, and I would like to share it with others. What have been done is introducing two new parameters:  return_paths=True: If True, the path will be computed and returned for all shortest paths - if False, the paths will not be computed.  add_weights_in=[]: A list with names of additional weights to be calculated. For every string in this list, the weight with the given string will be calculated and returned too.  Due to this new possibility of calculating additional weights, the return value needs to be changed a bit, but for backwards compatibiliy if add_weighs_in is empty, a tuple of two with (dist, paths) will be returned as always. If though the add_weights_in list contains values, a tuple of three will be returned, (dist, paths, add_weights), where add_weights contains a dictionary for every node with keys the same as the values of the add_weights_in list and values the computed distance.

Generate the Waxman graph (migrated from Trac #533)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/533 Reported 2011-04-01 by dirac.sat, assigned to @bjedwards.  Sharing a code which I wrote to generate the '''Waxman graphs''' (proposed by B.M.Waxman) Ref : B.M.Waxman (1988) Routing of multipoint connections. IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun. 6(9), 1617-1622.   In this model the nodes of the network are uniformly distributed in the plane and edges are added according to probabilities that depend on the distances between the nodes. The probability to have an edge between nodes u and v is given by :  P(u, v) = a*exp(-d/(bL)) where 0<a, b<=1, d is the distance from u to v, and L is the maximum distance between any two nodes. An increase in the parameter a increases the probability of edges between any nodes in the graph, while an increase in b yields a larger ratio of long edges to short edges.

Add bipartite normalization for centrality measures (migrated from Trac #528)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/528 Reported 2011-03-25 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  Some centrality measures (degree_centrality, betweenness_centrality and closeness_centrality) can be computed for bipartite networks using the same algorithms used for unipartite networks, but we need to adapt the normalization of such measures to the bipartite nature of the network (see reference).  I'm not sure of the best way to implement this feature in NetworkX, I see two main ways to do so: to modify centrality measures to accept the bipartite keyword (and a list of nodes in one bipartite set) or to add a new file to the bipartite module that implements the normalization for the relevant centrality measures.   As a first approximation I've attached an implementation of the second way. The main problem is that closeness_centrality normalizes (and inverts) by default the sum of the shortest paths for each node, so I've added a slightly modified closeness_centrality function to the file attached (with a bipartite input keyword) that returns the raw sum of shortest paths for each node. And then another function does the normalization for bipartite networks.  I've also attached a file that contains a function that returns the southern woman bipartite network (used in the chapter) in order to be able to test my implementation against the results provided by the authors.

draw_networkx_edge_labels wrongly calculates the middle point between two points for label position (migrated from Trac #527)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/527 Reported 2011-03-24 by cmf, assigned to Aric Hagberg <aric.hagberg.  The draw_networkx_edge_labels method, wrongly calculates the middle point position, between two nodes position, for edge label position. This is caused because the method does not force a float conversion of the node (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) positions, and if the positions are int's, the result will always be a int, hence losing precision.  i solved this problem by forcing a float conversion.  from this -> Line 830:  (x,y) = ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2) to this  (x,y) = ((float(x1)+float(x2))/2, (float(y1)+float(y2))/2)

I had problems because the current reader could not parse files that contained both *Edges and *Arcs sections, and it always expected a list of nodes to parse. That's the read_pajek function from version 1.5.dev_20110228003013.  So I made the parser more flexible and I'm happy with the results, I also uncommented some parts from the writer because it was producing extra lines with node and edge attributes. I don't know how the parser now fares against your tests. I hope it helps, though.

Modify mixing.py functions to be able to optionally operate only on sets of nodes (migrated from Trac #522)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/522 Reported 2011-03-14 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  Consider modify mixing.py functions related to degree, and maybe others if it makes sense, in order to optionally operate only on sets of nodes (the functions should still operate on all nodes by default). This would be useful to compute and analyze degree correlations in bipartite networks, as described in Latapy et al (2008) (see especially figure 3).  The script attached "correlations.py" contains an implementation that I did which does not use mixing.py functions, along with a function to plot the degree correlations for the coauthor network used in the paper and a random bipartite graph (which mimics the plots of figure 3 of the paper). This script also contains a function that uses the modified mixing.py functions (see patch attached) and it also tests that the two implementations yield the same results.  Regarding the patch, it adds a new input "nodes" parameter to degree_mixing_dict, neighborhood_connectivity_iter, neighbor_connectivity and node_degree_xy. I also had to modify neighborhood_connectivity_iter to normalize its results in order to match the results reported in the paper. This breaks a test of neighbor_connectivity which is also modified in the patch. I'm not sure that these modifications (especially normalization) do not break other use cases for this functions. So review and more test are necessary.  In order to run the script and reproduce the plot, you must download the graphml file from:    http://www.milnou.net/~jtorrents/bipartite_cc/coauthoring_latapy_2mode.graphml

Add an attribute to identify top and bottom nodes in bipartite_configuration_model (migrated from Trac #519)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/519 Reported 2011-03-11 by @jtorrents, assigned to @hagberg.  Another feature related to bipartite networks that I miss in NetworkX would be to include an attribute to identify top and bottom nodes in the random bipartite network generated by bipartite_configuration_model. This would be very useful because, in order to not overestimate the clustering of one-mode projections when we compare them to random networks (some kind of null model), it is an usual procedure to generate random bipartite networks using degree sequences of the actual bipartite network and then do the one-mode projection to obtain a more accurate null model for comparison with the actual one-mode projection.  Until now, as a workaround, I identify top and bottom nodes in random bipartite networks knowing that the id for the top nodes will be an integer less than len(top_degree_sequence). But to figure this out you have to look at the code of bipartite_configuration_model.  In the bipartite networks that I have to analyze I use the convention that I learned using igraph: to use a node attribute ("type") with values 0 or 1. Maybe NetworkX could also adopt this convention for bipartite random networks.

Overlapping nodes in draw_networkx (migrated from Trac #508)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/508 Reported 2011-02-15 by unknown, assigned to @hagberg.  For certain topologies and large number of nodes, draw_networkx displays overlapping nodes. The edges and labels among them may not be clear from the diagram. The spring_layout positions are supposed to take care of this (thru ideal length k = 1/sqrt(len(nodes)) and min distance = 0.01). However, the nodes are displayed with pylab's scatter function with the positions in the axis coordinates and marker sizes in pixels. So the non-overlap logic built into any layout algorithm will fail. The solution is to use specific pylab patches to display the network. The relevant replacement for pylab's scatter is shown in this [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009316/plot-scatter-position-and-marker-size-in-the-same-coordinates SO answer].

Redundant new node label creation in negative_edge_cycle and mincost (migrated from Trac #505)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/505 Reported 2011-02-09 by @loicseguin, assigned to @loicseguin.  In the new '''negative_edge_cycle''' function, there is a small code snippet to create a node label that is not already present in a graph. There is a function in the '''mincost''' module that does almost exactly the same thing. The only difference is that the function in '''mincost''' is a generator because it often needs to be called more than once.  Since these two small pieces of code a redundant, I suggest we put the function '''gen_node_label''' in the '''utils.py''' file. It seems to me that such a function can be used in many other occasions, thus putting it in the '''utils''' module is probably a good idea. Attached is a patch with the suggested modifications.

Test for negative edge cycle (migrated from Trac #504)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/504 Reported 2011-02-09 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  bellman_ford checks for a negative cycle in the source node's component. To check the whole graph for a negative cycle we are tempted to call bellman_ford with each node.  But it is faster to add a new node that connects to everyone and use bellman_ford on that graph and then remove that node.  Let's add this as a function.

Bellman Ford bug on unlucky path graph (migrated from Trac #502)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/502 Reported 2011-02-07 by @dschult, assigned to @loicseguin.  Bnx.bellman_ford(G,3) returns a negative cycle error for the path graph nx.path_graph(4) (which has all weights positive).  I think its just the check on the extreme case that the last node gets added on the last pass through the loop--but I'll make sure first.     Looks like some other parts of the code can be made faster too.  We don't need to consider edges that start at nodes we haven't seen yet.  Their length to source is infinite anyway.  I'll look at original paper to find out why they don't do that.

Improve performance of Graph.size() and Graph.number_of_edges() by caching the number of edges (migrated from Trac #495)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/495 Reported 2011-01-27 by chris.lasher, assigned to @hagberg.  Calls to `Graph.size()` and `Graph.number_of_edges()` take far too long for graphs with non-trivial numbers of edges. The problem stems from `Graph.size()` looping over every single node and summing the degree for that node. (As `Graph.number_of_edges()` calls `Graph.size()` when no arguments are provided, it follows that method suffers the same issue.)  The `Graph` instance ought to cache the number of edges present, simply by creating a `Graph._number_of_edges` attribute, set to `0` in `__init__`, then incrementing and decrementing this count for calls to `add_edge()` and `remove_edge()` (and their collective `nbunch` brethren) respectively. Then, when the user calls `size()` or `number_of_edges()`, simply `return self._number_of_edges` and be done with it.  Note that even if the user does provide the `weighted=True` parameter to `Graph.size()`, it still runs twice as long as it should because it loops over the nodes instead of the edges.

installation of pygraphviz under Windows does not work for end user (migrated from Trac #491)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/491 Reported 2011-01-08 by dasqua, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi,  I've had nothing but problems with the so called easy_install. It failed dismally then I had to download the thing manually because the easyinstall couldn't find graphviz library (it didn't look where the default graphviz installer put it).  Can a real installer be created?  I need something that can actually be installed rather than a recipe and wishful thinking. Invoking a C compiler really just doesn't cut it. Do you really expect end users to install a full compiler environment to draw a graph?   I had downloaded GraphViz, setuptools, etc,  Because easyinstall failed I had to then download the tar.gz file manually then edit its setup.py file to know where my graphvis was. Then I got nonsense about vcvars which I assume is the next step requiring a compiler.  I expect and tolerate this kind of thing under linux. A compiler there is built-in. Not under Windows.  I'm just trying to get a python module installed! I can get modules for databases, sdl and everything else installed on end-user machines without a problem.  Why so difficult?!

There was a small problem in the implementation. The usage of random.sample selected several times the same node, resulting in an inaddequate number of neighbors being added for each graph.

Make node_clique_number more efficient using simple observation (migrated from Trac #479)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/479 Reported 2010-11-26 by conradlee, assigned to @dschult.  If you want to know the clique number of a given node (i.e., the order of the largest clique in which that node is embedded), there is a nice function in NetworX called node_clique_number.  In this ticket I outline why this function, in some cases, is not as efficient as it could be, and I offer a simple solution.  Let's imagine that we have a big graph, and it takes a very long time to get the full list of cliques in this graph.  For this reason, let's assume that I have not yet computed the full list of cliques in the graph, or any list of cliques for that matter.  If I want to know the clique number of a given node, but I don't yet have a list of cliques, then the function node_clique_number will find all cliques in the graph, as you can see on line 420-421 below.  ''' 412 def node_clique_number(G,nodes=None,cliques=None):[[BR]] 413     """ Returns the size of the largest maximal clique containing[[BR]] 414         each given node.  415  416         Returns a single or list depending on input nodes. 417         Optional list of cliques can be input if already computed. 418  419     """ 420     if cliques is None: 421         cliques=list(find_cliques(G)) '''  However, this expensive global calculation is unnecessary.  The clique number is a local property, and so to calculate it we do not need to enumerate all cliques in the graph.  Instead, we could run the following:  ego_graph = G.subgraph(G.neighbors[node] + [node]) clique_number = ego_graph.graph_clique_number()  Thus, I propose replaceing line 421 with a couple of lines that first create the subgraph of the egocentric network (including the node in question), and then return the size of the maximum clique in that subgraph.  Is this clear enough?

Minor syntax changes to GML and GraphML (migrated from Trac #476)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/476 Reported 2010-11-25 by Simon Knight <simon.knight, assigned to @hagberg.  Hello, Sorry for the flood of formatting bug reports. Hopefully these are the last ones :) Please let me know if they should be split into separate reports.  1) The XML produced by the GraphML writer is all on one line. It might be worth pretty printing the output. A look on stack overflow suggests this requires a different module to be imported though, which may increase complexity: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3095434/inserting-newlines-in-xml-file-generated-via-xml-etree-elementtree-in-python  2) yED does not like GML files with strings that are unquoted.  From http://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles/doc/developers-guide/gml.html  "attribute [String] A key/value pair where the value is a quoted string."  It is hard to tell from the (now disappeared) GML spec http://web.archive.org/web/20080710044309/http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/gml-tr.html  String  ::= " instring "  But I believe they are meant to be quoted. To work around this I am currently creating a copied graph with the strings manually quoted. It would be cleaner to do this in the GML writer.  Thanks Simon

Error in edge ID when writing MultiGraph to GraphML (migrated from Trac #475)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/475 Reported 2010-11-24 by simon.knight, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi, Sorry for all the bug reports!  There is an issue when writing a MultiGraph to GraphML. If I create a MultiGraph and write it to GraphML:  ''' import networkx as nx G = nx.MultiGraph() G.add_edge(1,2) G.add_edge(1,3) nx.write_graphml(G, "test.graphml") '''  Then the edge id values are incorrect:  ''' <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd">     <graph edgedefault="undirected" id="">         <node id="1"/>         <node id="2"/>         <node id="3"/>         <edge id="0" source="1" target="2"/>         <edge id="0" source="1" target="3"/>     </graph> </graphml> '''  The edge id values in the file should be unique. This is confusing yED when I import the written GraphML file in.  The error arises because the edge id is being set based on the key in the multigraph iterator:             for u,v,key,data in G.edges_iter(data=True,keys=True):                   edge_element = Element("edge",source=str(u),target=str(v),                                         id=str(key))    In edges_iter, key refers to the index of the current edge, for the current source destination pair. It is not the global edge index. The problem arises when we use this key as the global index - and we see the id duplication above. This is a contrived example (I don't need a multigraph), but this problem is also present when we do have a true multigraph.  I think enumerating over all the edges, or providing an index would solve the problem. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks Simon

Error writing edge data to GraphML for network read from GML (migrated from Trac #474)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/474 Reported 2010-11-23 by simon.knight, assigned to @hagberg.  Summary: The GraphML writer unicode handling for nodes needs to also be extended to edges.  As per discussion with Aric on the Google Groups list, I was having unicode problems when writing a network in GraphML format, when I had read that network in from GML.  The email was:  > However if I read in the GML graph before writing to GraphML, then I get errors: >  > import networkx as nx > G=nx.path_graph(4) > nx.write_gml(G,'test.gml') > G=nx.read_gml('test.gml') > nx.write_graphml(G, 'test.graphml')  Aric: "That works for me with the latest networkx development version.  But it looks like you are having some unicode issues that we probably fixed."  I have since updated to the latest version from Mercurial, which has fixed the problem with nodes.  However I also have edge data, then I get the same unicode problem as before: import networkx as nx G=nx.path_graph(4) G.add_edge(1,4, speed=10) nx.write_gml(G,'test.gml') G=nx.read_gml('test.gml') nx.write_graphml(G, 'test.graphml')  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "netx_format_test.py", line 6, in <module>     nx.write_graphml(G, 'test.graphml')   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 75, in write_graphml     writer.add_graph_element(G)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 220, in add_graph_element     self.add_edges(G,graph_element)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 203, in add_edges     self.add_attributes("edge", edge_element, data, default)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 181, in add_attributes     default=default_value)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/networkx/readwrite/graphml.py", line 168, in add_data     key_id = self.get_key(name,self.xml_type[element_type], KeyError: <type 'unicode'>  Hopefully it is simple to extend the handling changes for nodes to edges.  Thanks! Simon

I've been using networkx to do some basic GIS topology work [https://bitbucket.org/gallipoli/utilitynetwork/ here] and thought I would push back in something that might be useful to someone. I'm honestly pretty new to all this (this is my first open source contribution to anything) so I would greatly appreciate any suggestions.  I'd particularly like ideas on the tests. Previously I used extensive mocking, but I was worried it was becoming too self-referential and unpythonic.   I noticed other readwrite modules just creating tempfiles and destroying them when finished, so I went that route. Only I couldn't use the built-in Python tempfile module because I couldn't get it to play nice as an [http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ OGR] datasource, so the test creates a real shapefile (which really consist of three files, .shp, .shx, .dbf) and destroys them when finished.

Add personalization/teleportation option to page rank algorithm (migrated from Trac #453)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/453 Reported 2010-10-29 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  The papers cited on the documentation page for nx.pagerank() (http://meyer.math.ncsu.edu/Meyer/PS_Files/Survey.pdf and http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/showDoc.Fulltext?lang=en&doc=1999-66&format=pdf) both discuss a "perturbation vector" used to render the stochastic matrix irreducible and avoid undesired trapping effects.  At present, nx only includes support for a uniform perturbation vector, which causes an idealized random walker on the network to spontaneously teleport to another site on the network with fixed probability.  I'd like to be able to specify a customized perturbation vector (preferably in the form of a dictionary indexed by node names) that would designate certain nodes as PageRank sources, creating a customized PageRank based on a non-uniform perturbation vector.

double_edge_swap doesn't work for directed graphs (migrated from Trac #447)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/447 Reported 2010-10-11 by hafets, assigned to @hagberg.  The double_edge_swap and connected_double_edge_swap functions should swap edges in a way that keeps all degrees the same. It works well for simple graphs, however it doesn't fit the case of directed graphs: it turns x->y, u->v into x->u, y->v, which changes the in- and out-degrees of u and y. Instead, x->y, u->v should become x->v, u->y. This way all in-degrees and out-degrees will remain the same.  Another thing regarding this function: I would like to have the option to make exactly the number of swaps that I ask (now the function promises 'at most' the number of swaps that I ask). I know there is a chance it will take plenty of time, if the graph is too dense. In order to avoid the case that the function runs forever, you can add another parameter: after how many tries of swaps you'll stop anyway.

Workaround: First build a list by edges_iter, and only _aftewards_ remove all edges by looping over remove_edge  See attached example program.  When this is expected behaviour please document this.

clustering coefficient (migrated from Trac #438)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/438 Reported 2010-09-23 by trac user Rashel2010, assigned to @hagberg.  I am trying to calculate the clustering coefficient of each node in a network. It is strange that I found some nodes with one degree have a nonzero clustering coefficient. I couldn't figure out why this happened.

Update documentation to refer to mercurial for source code (migrated from Trac #437)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/437 Reported 2010-09-22 by trac user morph, assigned to @hagberg.  Hello, in [1] it's said that "The code can be found on the NetworkX SVN server at http://networkx.lanl.gov/svn/networkx/trunk." while on [2] it's said that "The NetworkX master source repository uses Mercurial.  Use: hg clone http://networkx.lanl.gov/hg/networkx"  [1] http://networkx.lanl.gov/ [2] https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac  I think documentation needs an update :) (maybe there are other references for SVN still there)  Regards, Sandro

networkx.css missing from released tarball (migrated from Trac #436)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/436 Reported 2010-09-22 by trac user morph, assigned to @hagberg.  Hello, in the released tarball the file doc/source/static/networkx.css is missing, and so creating documentation from that tarball will end up with a "quite ugly" result.  It's probably just needed to add '*.css' in this line in MANIFEST.in  recursive-include doc *.py *.rst Makefile *.html *.png *.txt  Regards, Sandro

**kwds not passed on by draw_networkx_nodes (migrated from Trac #391)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/391 Reported 2010-08-05 by trac user Jon Olav Vik, assigned to @hagberg.  I just started using networkx, and it seems to be very useful. In my explorations I came across a minor bug:  The docstring for draw_networkx_nodes() says: "Any keywords not listed above are passed through to Matplotlib's scatter function." However, the **kwds argument is never actually used.  Suggested change: Add ", **kwds" inside the parenthesis in line 401 (see below).  Once I figured out the bug, it can easily be worked around by setting properties on the handle returned, e.g. setp(nx.draw_networkx_nodes(...), edgecolors="none")  The *_kwds argument is also specified but unused in draw_networkx_edges, draw_networkx_labels, draw_networkx_edge_labels, but here the documentation says nothing about *_kwds. However, I think it should be safe to tag **kwds onto all calls to pyplot in these functions too, rather than silently swallow the extra keyword arguments.  https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/browser/networkx/trunk/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py?rev=1844  ''' 278 def draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, ... 289                         *_kwds): ... 343     Any keywords not listed above are passed through to Matplotlib's 344     scatter function. ... 393     node_collection=ax.scatter(xy[:,0], xy[:,1], ... 401                                linewidths=linewidths) ''' ''' 409 def draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, ... 420                         *_kwds): ''' ''' etc. '''

Flow algorithm should return dict instead of graph (migrated from Trac #390)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/390 Reported 2010-08-05 by @loicseguin, assigned to @loicseguin.  The ford_fulkerson algorithm returns the value of a maximum flow as well as a graph with the same node and edge sets as the input graph but where edges have an attribute 'flow'.  I now think that this is probably not the best design decision. It is probably overkill to return a whole graph when only flows on edges are actually of interest. It would probably be better to return a dict flowDict keyed by edges containing the flows on the edges. Then the flow on edge (u, v) could be accessed by flowDict[(u, v)].  Also, it could return a dict of dict flowDict such that the flow on edge (u, v) is accessed by flowDict[u][v].  Since ford_fulkerson was released in 1.2, this would entail a change of API for this function. But better do it now than in a couple of release when more people are likely to rely on the current return values.  I would like to sort that out before committing other flow algorithms in order to have a uniform interface for flow algorithms.  Any thoughts?

Following up on [http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss/browse_thread/thread/75d67870f60213d7# this thread] in the mailing list, here is a suggested new kind of exception for when algorithms terminate unexpectedly. I called the exception NetworkXUnexpectedResult.  For instance, this class could be used when a shortest path algorithm does not find any path or when a max flow algorithm finds an infinite capacity path.  I'd mostly like to have feedback on the name of the exception. I also thought about NetworkXNoResult and NetworkXTermination.

dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance may return incorrect result with Multigraphs. (migrated from Trac #380)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/380 Reported 2010-07-28 by unknown, assigned to @hagberg.  When operating on parallel edges in a multigraph, dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance does not choose the edge between two nodes that has the minimum weight. Instead, it chooses the edge who's attr_dict is considered to be the smallest by min(). This can give incorrect results when the edges have more than one attribute.  Example code: import networkx G = networkx.MultiGraph() G.add_edge('a', 'b', foo=5, weight=100) G.add_edge('a', 'b', bar=1, weight=110) networkx.dijkstra_predecessor_and_distance(G, 'a') # ({'a': [], 'b': ['a']}, {'a': 0, 'b': 110})  This bug is present in the current release and in svn revision 1792 (HEAD at this time).  Note that single_source_dijkstra handles multigraphs similarly, but correctly.

Methods need to be changed to handle (migrated from Trac #374)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/374 Reported 2010-07-23 by trac user Howard H., assigned to @hagberg.  The mailing list discussion at  http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss/browse_thread/thread/edc1b0ad6728243e# suggested some ideas for persistent storage of NetworkX graphs.  Attached is an example of how to do this using shelve. Use it like this:  > > > G=PersistentGraph(file='graph.db') > > > G.add_edge('a','b') > > > del G  # closes file graph.db > > > G=PersistentGraph(file='graph.db')  > > > print G.edges() > > > [('b', 'a')]  This version works with both writeback=True and writeback=False for the shelve. See  http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/node328.html for an example of the difference. For writeback=True only a very simple modification of the Graph() class code is necssary to use a shelve instead of dict as the underlying data structure. For writeback=False a few methods need to be changed to handle the persistence correctly.  There is also test (run with nosetests -v) to demonstrate that it at least passes the "smoke test".  Some drawbacks to this approach:  Only the adjacency structure is stored (as a shelve dict-of-dicts) - no metadata about the graph (e.g graph type).  It is obviously slower. I didn't do any benchmarks.  Only strings are allowed as shelve keys. So nodes must be strings.  If this has decent performance it may be useful to incorporate into NetworkX. Either as an option in the existing graph classes or as as separate graph classes.  Howard, [http://radiologydegreeonline.net/ Radiologist]

AttributeError: 'DiGraph' object has no attribute 'add_weighted_edges_from' (migrated from Trac #373)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/373 Reported 2010-07-23 by alessandro.filisetti, assigned to @hagberg.  Good morning,   I'm trying to use networkx on ubuntu 10.4 (lucid). I wrote a simple script to analyse some network but I find this error:  ''' AttributeError: 'DiGraph' object has no attribute 'add_weighted_edges_from' '''  I'm using the same script on MacOs and I don't have such a problem.  I have also tried to test the package with a simple   ''' import networkx as nt a = nt.DiGraph() a.add_weighted_edges_from(1,2,3) '''  but the system returns the same error.   Moreover when I import the networkx package the system return the following warning:  '''  ---  matplotlib.numerix and all its subpackages are deprecated. They will be removed soon.  Please use numpy instead.  ---  '''  Do you have some idea about that?  Best,   Alessandro Filisetti

The "Quick Example" from your front page works after commenting out these two lines. I can't comment if everything else works since I'm just starting to use nx.

Updating Dijkstra algorithms to accept optional weight argument (migrated from Trac #366)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/366 Reported 2010-07-01 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  Currently single_source_dijkstra can handle either an unweighted graph, or a graph whose weights have been assigned with the name 'weight'.  I might choose a different name and presently each edge has several assigned weights, and depending on context I would like to call dijkstra with a different weight.  It appears the code can be altered quite easily to accept an optional argument:  def single_source_dijkstra(G,source,target=None,cutoff=None, weight = 'weight'):  Then simply remove quotes around each appearance of 'weight' in the code.  Similar changes should apply to all the dijkstra's algorithm methods.

Misc Power Law Degree Distribution functions (migrated from Trac #364)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/364 Reported 2010-06-25 by @bjedwards, assigned to @hagberg.  This is a couple of functions that have written on scratch files more times than I would like to count, because they never seem worth it to save them. Well I got annoyed and saved them, the cumulative complement degree distribution functions.  Also included is a function for estimating the parameter for a power-law degree distribution of a graph(if it has one), laid out in Clauset, reference in the function. This of course comes with the caveat, that the degree distribution actually is power law.  I plan on adding the function for estimating dmin as well, as well as the Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests also outlined in Clauset, though some of that has been implemented elsewhere.   http://code.google.com/p/agpy/wiki/PowerLaw?ts=1251337886&updated=PowerLaw  This might go as a mention that a direction networkx could go is being able to test the validity of various metrics on a graph, and provide ways to compare them. This is an area where other packages are lacking and could be a good place for us to expand.

find_cliques consumes too much memory (migrated from Trac #355)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/355 Reported 2010-05-11 by boyska, assigned to @hagberg.  I know that the problem of finding maximum/maximal problem is NP-complete on the time, but I have been surprised that networkx's implementation even consumes tons of memory. Indeed, with a graph of 4096 nodes, it goes "Out of memory", and this is so bad.  I think that: 1. This should be documented (this is a defect) 2. There are some algorithms that consumes much less memory (and much more time). It would be cool to offer both of them in the API (this is an enhancement).

"close_fh" option for draw() (migrated from Trac #343)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/343 Reported 2010-04-19 by ctdecci, assigned to @chebee7i.  It would be nice to add a an option for AGraph.draw() that explicitly tells it to close the fh specified by the path argument (True by default).  This would make it useful for creating graph images on-the-fly with StringIO.StringIO for later re-reading.  With the current setup, if a StringIO instance is passed in, it is closed before draw() returns, so it can no longer be read by the calling function.  One example is creating an image on-the-fly for returning it in an HTTP response.  Something like the following might work:  ''' def draw(self,path=None,format=None,prog=None,args='',close_fh=True):    ...    if path is not None:        old_path = path        fh=self._get_fh(path,'w+b')        fh.write("".join(data))        if not (old_path is path and not close_fh):            fh.close()        ...

unexpected result from barabasi_albert_graph() (migrated from Trac #340)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/340 Reported 2010-04-16 by leisenman, assigned to @hagberg.  I'm using **version** = '1.1.dev1516' under ubuntu   I expected that all nodes in a graph created with barabasi_albert_graph(n,m) would have at least m edges. However this is not the case. For example:  import networkx as nx G=nx.barabasi_albert_graph(50,3,None,1) print G.degree()  Note that the third element has only one edge. I think this is a result of the algorithm that first creates m nodes with no edges and then adds nodes each with m edges. In some cases, one of the original nodes does not have at least m edges.  It isn't what I wanted, but in general, is this behavior correct?  I wrote a version that I think is guaranteed to have all nodes have at least m edges. Would this be of interest to the project?

The degree() (and in_degree(), out_degree()) methods have an option with_labels=True to return a dictionary instead of a list.  The most common use case is to want a dictionary and in that case the degree values can easily retrieved with k=G.degree().values().  I propose changing the API to remove the with_labels keyword and always return dictionaries except in the case when a single node is specified as input in nbunch= when a single value should be returned.   '''  ``` def degree(self, nbunch=None, weighted=False):     """Return the degree of a node or nodes.      The node degree is the number of edges adjacent to that node.       Parameters     ----------     nbunch : iterable container, optional (default=all nodes)         A container of nodes.  The container will be iterated         through once.         weighted : bool, optional (default=False)        If True return the sum of edge weights adjacent to the node.        Returns     -------     nd : dictionary or number         A dictionary with nodes as keys and degree as values or a         single number if a single node is specified on input      Examples     --------     >>> G = nx.Graph()   # or DiGraph, MultiGraph, MultiDiGraph, etc     >>> G.add_path([0,1,2,3])     >>> G.degree(0)     1     >>> G.degree([0,1])     {0: 1, 1: 2}     >>> G.degree([0,1]).values()     [1, 2]      """     if nbunch in self:      # return a single node         return self.degree_iter(nbunch,weighted=weighted).next()[1]     else:         return dict(self.degree_iter(nbunch,weighted=weighted)) ```  '''

attracting component (migrated from Trac #336)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/336 Reported 2010-04-13 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.  For directed graphs, some nodes are exist in an attractor set.  Proposal is to add functions for calculating the attracting components of a graph.  Patch is attached.  They are fairly simple, but if this is desired, I can commit it and write the unit tests as well.

A simple method for viewing graphs via pygraphviz. (migrated from Trac #335)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/335 Reported 2010-04-13 by @chebee7i, assigned to @hagberg.  Our group has been using a simple draw() method.  I thought it would be a nice addition to NetworkX as well.  We have a draw() method on each graph class which calls a default draw method (imports are done in the method).  Until drawing is handled better in matplotlib, this function might be a nice default option.   I'll commit it next. It is called view_pygraphviz() rather than draw_pygraphviz() since "draw" currently seems to make implications about matplotlib being used.

Cytoscape is a software to edit and visualize networks widely used in bioinformatics.  However, I can't read GML files created by Cytoscape with networkx. You can find an example gml file created with Cytoscape attached to this report.

Maybe it is related to a problem of whitespaces, but the error message is not clear at all.

epsilon improvement in _bidirectional_pred_succ (migrated from Trac #319)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/319 Reported 2010-03-08 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  The reason it is faster to do find a path using dijkstra-like algorithms in both directions is that the 'fringes' we find don't get as large before they intersect.  Basically if we expand two circles about each node, their combined area when they intersect is small compared to the area we would get if we just did one large circle centered at one node and wait for the circle to contain the other node.  If for some reason the 'circle' around one node grows much faster than the other, we lose some of this benefit. It will be slightly faster if we try to keep the fringes the same size - that is, move out from whichever one has the smaller fringe.  This can be done by adding a single if/else bit at the end.  See attached.

Currently the contents of both nx_agraph and nx_pydot are imported by networkx.drawing.**init** even when their dependencies don't exist (i.e., pygraphviz and pydot).

Calling networkx.draw without passing in an ax argument results in the following code being executed:  ''' def draw(G, pos=None, ax=None, hold=None, **kwds): ...     cf=pylab.gcf()     cf.set_facecolor('w')     if ax is None:         if cf._axstack() is None:             ax=cf.add_axes((0,0,1,1))         else:             ax=cf.gca() '''  The axes created by cf.add_axes((0,0,1,1)) does not allow the title to be set using either pylab.title or axes.set_title.  The pylab.gca function actually already encapsulates axes creation, using slightly different code:  ''' def gca(self, *_kwargs): ...     ax = self._axstack()     if ax is not None: return ax     return self.add_subplot(111, *_kwargs) '''  I suggest that the networkx.draw function be simplified to the following, and let matplotlib handle the axes creation.  ''' def draw(G, pos=None, ax=None, hold=None, **kwds): ...     cf=pylab.gcf()     cf.set_facecolor('w')     if ax is None:         ax=cf.gca() '''  This allows normal pylab title setting, and probably other functionality that has not been discovered to be broken.

graph weights for colormap (migrated from Trac #293)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/293 Reported 2009-11-17 by trac user billb, assigned to @hagberg.  It seems like weights are not that well supported. There is no edge.weight for example.    This is the simplest way I could figure to make a graph where the weights are shown as a colormap:  nx.draw(G,node_size=50,font_size=10,edge_cmap=pylab.cm.cool,edge_color=map(lambda x: x['weight'],zip(*G.edges(data=True))[2]))  I would think the default behavior should be to display the weights somehow when they are present.   It was not clear from the documentation what behavior is when edge_vmax is None.

mincost maxflow support (migrated from Trac #291)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/291 Reported 2009-11-11 by mfrasca, assigned to @hagberg.  I did not find this algorithm (minimal cost maximal flow) in the library and I wonder whether it might be added, that is: if it fits in the library.  I have a possible primal-dual implementation, it is based on augmenting the solution with the next cheapest augmenting flow. it uses the heapq library and I can attach it to this ticket as soon as it's reviewed.

speed up connected_double_edge_swap (migrated from Trac #290)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/290 Reported 2009-11-07 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  The algorithm connected_double_edge_swap tests at the beginning that the network is connected.  So when we swap edges (u,v) and (x,y) for (u,x) and (v,y) we know that it was connected just before this swap.  Currently the algorithm tests if the network is still connected.  However, if there is still a path from u to v, the resulting network will be connected.  All that is needed is to run bidirectional dijkstra to see if u and v are connected.  This should be quite a bit faster.  Here's the snippet of code  ```         if (not G.has_edge(u,x)) and (not G.has_edge(v,y)):             ...         n+=1         wcount+=1     if networkx.is_connected(G): # increase window         window+=1     else: # undo changes from previous window, decrease window ```  What's really needed is something at the end like:  if networkx.has_path(u,v):  so adding a function like has_path (which would be based on bidirectional dijstra) to return True or False might also be a useful feature.

Edgelist reads data only in 'weights' variable (migrated from Trac #276)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/276 Reported 2009-09-15 by akhalak, assigned to @hagberg.  The edgelist reader has an option to read in three columns, and to assign the third column to the 'weights' field.  In the documentary comment, it has the following example.  With edge data:::  ```  # source target data  a b 1  a c 3.14159  d e apple ```  However, when the example file is loaded in, it can't be displayed using draw() because the default spring layout used by draw() requires that the 'weights' field if defined should be an integer.    Would it be possible to have an optional argument to read_edgedata() that specifies which data group to place the data (and perhaps put it in 'weight' as a default)?

ffnet not working well with networkx-1.0rc1? (migrated from Trac #274)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/274 Reported 2009-09-09 by churaesie, assigned to @hagberg.  On a separate machine (running Leopard 10.5.8), I have gotten python 2.6 and associated python packages working with the svn copy of ffnet and networkx-0.99 and everything is fine.  On my own machine however (also Leopard 10.5.8 using python 2.6), installed both networkx-0.99 (from macports) AND networkx-1.0rc1 (from easy_install - the latest release).  Unfortunately, the svn copy of ffnet doesn't seem to be getting along with networkx-1.0rc1  ( I think this is the problem, anyway..)  I suspect that if I could get python2.6 to default to using networkx-0.99, then the svn ffnet would work, but unfortunately I have not found an effective way of uninstalling or removing networkx-1.0rc1.  When I use python2.6 >>>import networkx >>> help(networkx) , the version info lists networkx-1.0rc1   the following error is what I get when I try testing the ffnet install:  > > > import ffnet > > > from ffnet import ffnet, mlgraph, savenet, loadnet, exportnet > > > conec = mlgraph((2,2,1)) > > > net = ffnet(conec) > > > Traceback (most recent call last): > > >   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> > > >   File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ffnet/ffnet.py", line 334, in **init** > > >     bgraph, bconecno = _bconec(conec, inno) > > >   File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ffnet/ffnet.py", line 209, in _bconec > > >     bgraph.delete_nodes_from(inno) > > > AttributeError: 'DiGraph' object has no attribute 'delete_nodes_from'

attribute array (migrated from Trac #268)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/268 Reported 2009-08-28 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.  I've started using a function repeatedly and thought it might be useful to others as well.  Essentially, the idea is to create a NumPy array from attributes in the graph.  This particular function will have as many rows/columns as there are values for a particular node attribute.  The values of the array are either counts or running totals of the values for a particular edge attribute.  I've attached the function here with a simple example.  Comments/thoughts/suggestions are appreciated.

doctest failures whenever resources not available (migrated from Trac #263)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/263 Reported 2009-08-17 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.  Running:  ''' nosetests --with-networkx-doctest --doctest-extension=txt '''  causes failures on nx_pydot.txt and nx_yaml.txt whenever pydot or yaml are not present.  Also, nx_vtk.py fails to load during testing if vtk is not present.  nx_vtk.py can be fixed using the lazy import.  As to pydot and yaml, these can be fixed by converting the doctests to the nose format and then raising SkipTest if we can't perform the ncessary import.

Allow to_numpy_matrix to query any edge attribute (migrated from Trac #260)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/260 Reported 2009-08-16 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.  Currently,  to_numpy_matrix will use the 'weight' attribute if it exists in the edge attribute dictionary.  At times, one might want the 0-1 matrix, even if the graph does provides weights.  Also, one might want to pull from some other edge attribute, like 'thickness'.    Proposal: edge_attr='weight' as a new argument.  Below is an implementation with some flexibility. It also re-adds reasonable behavior for multigraphs.

creating a random clustered network (migrated from Trac #251)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/251 Reported 2009-07-10 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  Both myself and Mark Newman have simultaneously developed an algorithm for creating some random clustered networks.  The amount of clustering is limited.  However, the algorithm itself is based on the configuration model and allows a number of analytic techniques to be used.  Here is code for creating such a network.  The references are:  J. C. Miller "Percolation and Epidemics on Random Clustered Graphs.  Physical Review E, Rapid Communication (to appear).  M.E.J. Newman, "Random clustered networks".  Physical Review Letters (to appear)  Both of these are on arxiv (and our respective web pages) and will probably be published in the next month.

minor bug in configuration_model (migrated from Trac #250)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/250 Reported 2009-07-10 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  configuration_model([1,2,2,2,3])  creates a network G with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  We might expect the degree of 0 to be 1, but in fact:  G.degree(0)=3  G.degree(1)=1  G.degree(2)=2  G.degree(3)=2  G.degree(4)=2  This is because the code has:  120     for n in G:  121         for i in range(deg_sequence[n-1]):  122             stublist.append(n)  To make it a bit cleaner, use deg_sequence[n] rather than deg_sequence[n-1] and it will behave as expected.  I suspect this dates to an earlier version when the random graph's first node was 1?

documentation typo in configuration_model (migrated from Trac #249)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/249 Reported 2009-06-30 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  The documentation claims:  "A non-graphical degree sequence (i.e. one not realizable by some simple graph) will raise an Exception."  In fact  configuration_model([2])  creates a graph with a single node and an edge to itself.  This is fine, but not a simple graph.  In fact the only issue that raises an exception is a degree sequence with an odd sum.

How is the nightly tarball created?  If it is the result of a 'svn export', I think the result will be that the revision information is missing.

ZeroFloatDivision eigenvector centrality (migrated from Trac #237)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/237 Reported 2009-03-20 by trac user diederik, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi Aric,  when calculating the eigenvector centrality for a very small network then it will throw an ZeroFloatDivision Error. For example, it is not possible to calculate the eigenvector centrality for this network:  import networkx as nx G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_edge('1','2') G.add_edge('1','3') G.add_edge('1','4') ec = nx.eigenvector_centrality(G)  a simple fix would be to add a try / except statement around row 679: s=1.0/sum(x.values()) and turn it into: try:     s=1.0/sum(x.values()) except ZeroDivisionError:     s= 1.0   i am not sure what the accurate eigenvector centrality score should be for a such a star network but at least this won't make it go south.  best, Diederik

Hi Aric,  I stumbled upon this small thing on a Windows machine (I must admit that I have not been able to get pygraphviz to work completely on a a windows machine, but I am pretty sure that this error is in that sense unrelated). I have googled 'close_fds is not supported on Windows platforms' and more modules are affected. i think the solution is straightforward, you have to change close_fds= True in close_fds=False  in the function call for windows versions. It could be that python 2.4 is also affected.

LabeledGraph add_nodes_from parses the node/data pairs in an incomplete way (migrated from Trac #233)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/233 Reported 2009-02-23 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  LabeledGraph.add_nodes_from() checks for a TypeError when unpacking a potential node/data pair.  That method doesn't catch the ValueError that arises when the node is a string (or other unpackable) that doesn't have 2 elements.  This also brings up the potential surprise that adding nodes like 'ac' loads a node 'a' with label 'c'.

Avoid using class variables (migrated from Trac #230)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/230 Reported 2009-02-17 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.  In the VF2 isomorphism implementation, the !GraphMatcher and !DiGraphMatchers make use a class variables in GMState and DiGMState.  For example, GMState.core_1.  This is functional, but it would have problems if two (or more) isomorphism checks were running simultaneously.  Another problem is that if one ever needs to subclass the GMState or DiGMState classes, then one would have to re-implement any method in the *Matcher classes which made explicit use of the state class name.  I ran into this problem, and it really defeats the whole purpose of subclassing.  The proposal is to store the class variables as attributes of the matcher class.  Then, the set of state variables will be tied to the !GraphMatcher or !DiGraphMatcher instance.

Use dictionary for multigraph edge storage (migrated from Trac #225)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/225 Reported 2009-02-11 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  Using a dictionary instead of a list as the data for multigraphs would allow the use of keys to distinguish between parallel edges.  E.g.  ''' M=nx.MultiGraph() M.add_edge(1,2,key='one',data=1) M.add_edge(1,2,key='two',data=2) ''' could be stored internaly as  ''' M.adj={1: {2: {'one': 1, 'two': 2}}, 2: {1: {'one': 1, 'two': 2''' ''' and then the edge data can be retrieved with '''  > > > print M[1][2]['one'] > > > 1 > > > print M[1][2]['two'] > > > 1 > > > '''

The Watts-Strogatz procedure for generating a small world network is specified in the following paper: [[BR]][[BR]] D.J. Watts & S.H. Strogatz. Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks. Nature, 393:440--442, 1998. [[BR]][[BR]] The module '''networkx/generators/random_graphs.py''' contains the function '''watts_strogatz_graph()''' for generating a Watts-Strogatz small world graph. However, the current behaviour of this function is that its output is a rewired graph that's not guaranteed to be connected, a property of rewired graphs that's required by (Watts & Strogatz 1998).

Provide isomorphism checks for weighed graphs (migrated from Trac #215)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/215 Reported 2008-12-30 by @chebee7i, assigned to @hagberg.  It might be useful to provide an option to check for isomorphisms on weighted graphs.  This was added in [1112], so that it could be tested and examined easily.  Nothing in NetworkX references these yet, so we can remove them easily too.  One way to incorporate these might be through a modification of is_isomorphic().

find all isomorphisms and fix subgraph bug (migrated from Trac #214)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/214 Reported 2008-12-26 by @chebee7i, assigned to @chebee7i.

The plan is to do this by adding two methods: - isomorphisms_iter - subgraph_isomorphisms_iter  On doing so, make sure to address: ''' Consider the following three graphs:  g1.add_edge("A", "B") g1.add_edge("B", "C")  g2.add_edge("Y", "Z")  g3.add_edge("Z", "Y")  g2 and g3 are subgraph isomorphic to g1 and both should return two matches, but g3 only returns one match. The node labels should not matter, which is why I think there is a problem with the candidate pairs and the ordering of the node set. Not having studied the code closely, this is only a guess, though.  '''

Getting the edge data with G[u][v] is the fastest way to access it directly.  But setting G[u][v] breaks the internal Graph() G.adj data structure (doesn't set G[v][u]). Either fix (see #206) or warning clearly against doing that. Similar for DiGraph.

Handle optional packages/dependencies better (migrated from Trac #197)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/197 Reported 2008-12-01 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  There are currently several optional packages that can be used with NetworkX (e.g. Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, YAML, pydot, PyGraphviz,...).  Currently NetworkX tries to import them and silently fails if they are not available (and the corresponding functionality is thus not available).    Is there a better way to handle this that could provide more transparency when something is missing or not working?    Also currently each function or module that uses an optional package must try to import that package.  If more functionality is added (say algebraic algorithms with Numpy and Scipy) then  this method will get very messy.

Hi,  I was just wondering, is it a deliberate design choice to have the neighborhood method default to only the successor edges in a directed graph? Or is in graph the neighborhood in a directed graph equal to its successors? If the neighborhood function would encompass both predecessors and successors in a directed graph then it would be easier to write algorithms that apply to both direct and undirected graphs.   best, Diederik

IsSuccessor / IsPredecessor / IsDirected Method? (migrated from Trac #194)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/194 Reported 2008-11-28 by trac user diederik, assigned to @hagberg.  Hi,   I have been working with Networkx for a short while now and it's a great package! IMHO, it would be quite usefull to have a IsSuccessor and IsPredecessor method that you can call with i and j as parameters. So you can ask is I a predecessor of J. Obviously, there are workarounds right now but it might make life a bit more easy :)   The same would apply for an IsDirected method which would have 1 paramater as input (the graph). Right now you can do: if type(g)== nx.Digraph() but I am not sure if that is the most Pythonic way of coding.   Anyway, great package!!!!  Best, Diederik

Report error when using read_pajek (migrated from Trac #192)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/192 Reported 2008-11-25 by trac user persue, assigned to @hagberg.  My verision is networkx0.99 when I was trying to use read_pajek() in  \Python24\Lib\site-packages\networkx\readwrite\pajek.py, it always report error. I checked the source code that found that read_pajek() calls parse_pajek() and there is a line G=networkx.XDiGraph(selfloops=True) in parse_pajek()  But it seems that I cann't find XDiGraph in the networkx package.

networkx matplotlib chaco incompatibility (migrated from Trac #178)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/178 Reported 2008-10-05 by danhomerick, assigned to @hagberg.

This is on Linux (Ubuntu) with Python 2.5, networkx 0.37 (latest release), and Chaco 3.0.0, and matplotlib 0.91 (version available in the Ubuntu repository).  It only occurs when matplotlib is installed. Removing matplotlib allows you to import networkx without issue. Interestingly, using 'import matplotlib' in the same script does not cause any problems.

Make draw work with file-like objects. (migrated from Trac #177)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/177 Reported 2008-09-19 by trac user kioopi, assigned to unknown.  The methos ''_get_fh'' in ''agraph.py'' checks with '''  hasattr(path, 'seek') ''' if it got a file-handle passed as path. There are file-like objects that don't have that method (i.e. the [http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/#httpresponse-objects Response object] of Django).[[BR]]  If the check is changed to test for the method 'write' it is possible to pass a django-response object to G.draw(). Which is cool because so its possible to generate graphs on the fly without having to hit the disk of the webserver.[[BR]]  I've attached a patch with the (pretty minimal) change and some tests to prove everything should work as usual.

Frozen Graphs (migrated from Trac #176)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/176 Reported 2008-09-07 by @chebee7i, assigned to @hagberg.  Recently, I have begun freezing my graphs and I thought it would be better if this were implemented as part of the library.  Here is my use case:  Once a graph is complete, there are some computations I'd like to do once and only once.  Also, there are some methods which should not be called unless the graph is frozen (ex: graphs which work with stochastic matrices).  Finally, if the user attempts to modify a frozen graph, I'd like an error output.  My thought was that this should not be a _new_ class, but rather a new feature of all graphs.   Possible Interface:  ''' def freeze(self):     # Sub classes could override this method to do some extra computations.     self._frozen = True  def unfreeze(self):     self._frozen = False  def add_node(self, n):     if self._frozen:         raise(networkx.FrozenError('Graph is frozen and cannot be modified.'))     elif n not in self.adj:         self.adj[n]={} # ...  '''  Though, since we are at Python 2.4, maybe properties should be considered?  The biggest downside to using properties in this case is that they are not easily overridden. For example,   [http://infinitesque.net/articles/2005/enhancing%20Python%27s%20property.xhtml]  Anyway, I think that this could be very useful feature.  Without this being implemented at the base level, a subclass would have to redefine every method which might modify the graph.  Thoughts?

Documentation of small world graphs doesn't mention that k being odd means k-->k-1 (migrated from Trac #163)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/163 Reported 2008-06-24 by @dschult, assigned to @dschult.  newman_watts_strogatz_graph and watts_strogatz_graph each accept a parameter k which represent the number of neighbors for each node in the underlying ring.  When k is odd, the nodes are actually only connected to the nearest k-1 neighbors.  Thus watts_strogatz_graph(5,1,0) is an empty graph.  This could have been made more clear by the creators of this model by defining k to be the number of neighbors on each side of the node (so that each node has 2k neighbors.  But I think we should deal with the ambiguity through documentation rather than redefinition.

to_agraph duplicates edges when multiedges==True (migrated from Trac #162)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/162 Reported 2008-06-03 by @chebee7i, assigned to @hagberg.  to_agraph() from networkx.drawing.nx_agraph duplicates edges when multiedges is True.  ''' # !python  > > > import networkx > > > a = networkx.XDiGraph(multiedges=True) > > > a.add_edges_from([(0,1,1),(1,0,2),(1,0,3)] > > > networkx.to_agraph(a) > > > digraph  { > > >         0 -> 1; > > >         1 -> 0; > > >         1 -> 0; > > >         1 -> 0; > > >         1 -> 0; > > > } > > > '''  The problem is due to an interplay between edges_iter() and get_edge().  edges_iter returns (u,v,x) while get_edge (for a multiedge graph) returns a list of all the edge data. One solution is to just add the edge from edges_iter.    It looks like the original motivation for walking through the edge data was that one might want different attributes for each multiedge.  Note that simply passing edge_attr into to_agraph() will not achieve this effect, as it is not possible to distinguish multiedges in a dictionary keyed by (u,v).  The main mechanism for adding this edge data is to assume that the edge data is a dictionary.  It would be nice if there were a generic way for non-dictionary classes to specify their edge data.  One way would be to include a try/except clause to see if the edge data has an edge_attr attribute.  I have attached a diff which includes a fix for the bug.  It also includes the additional try/except clause.

bug report: function "edge_betweenness" in the centrality module goes wrong (migrated from Trac #159)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/159 Reported 2008-05-09 by trac user syzheng, assigned to @hagberg.  Recently I used the "edge_betweenness" function in the centrality module, and unfortunately, something goes wrong.  the attached file is the dataset I used. Here blow is the code:  import networkx as nx G=nx.readwrite.read_gml('karate.gml') eb = nx.centrality.edge_betweenness(G)  I tried to figure out the bug. It seems that in the centrality.py, there is a line (line 307) as   betweenness[edge] += edgeFlow  here, the edge is defined from the source and target vertex (v,w). However, in the graph G, the edges look like (v, w, None), so the exception reported is "KeyError: (30, 34)"

Optional arrows when drawing edges for DiGraph (migrated from Trac #135)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/135 Reported 2008-01-07 by @chebee7i, assigned to @hagberg.  When using draw_networkx_edges with a digraph, it would be useful if the option was available to _not_ draw directed edges.  An easy way to do this presently is by passing in an empty graph:  ''' a = DiGraph() a.add_edge(1,2) pos = spring_layout(a) draw_networkx_edges(Graph(), pos, a.edges()) '''  It would be nice if I could do something like the following instead:  ''' a = DiGraph() a.add_edge(1,2) pos = spring_layout(a) draw_networkx_edges(a, pos, arrows=False) '''  In the code, perhaps: '''     if G.is_directed() and arrows: '''  with arrows=True as the default value.

configuration_model should not test is_valid_degree_sequence and should run faster (migrated from Trac #131)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/131 Reported 2007-12-13 by trac user joelmiller, assigned to @hagberg.  The present version of configuration_model no longer requires the returned graph to be a simple graph.  Consequently, the test to see if the degree sequence is realizable in a simple graph is unneeded.  The only test that is needed is to make sure that the degree sequence gives an even total.  Note that this means a single node with an edge to itself is considered to have degree 2.  Further, the process of joining edges at present is unnecessarily slow.  It pulls out a random pair of stubs and joins them, but this requires reassigning all entries of the stublist.  It is more efficient to simply shuffle the stublist and join adjacent nodes.  See attached code.

to_pygraphviz Agraph issues (migrated from Trac #128)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/128 Reported 2007-11-18 by @chebee7i, assigned to @hagberg.  Concerning  to_pygraphviz() in:    https://networkx.lanl.gov/browser/networkx/trunk/networkx/drawing/nx_pygraphviz.py  1) I was wondering why this function is needed.  It seems like to_agraph() does everything this function does, but perhaps with a bit more functionality.  So perhaps this function can be removed?  If not, it would be helpful to have explanation as to when one should use this function and how it is intended to supplement what to_agraph() provides.  2) Also, it looks like to_pygraphviz is using an older API...in the most recent revision, the function does not work. When creating the graph, it uses:  '''   A = pygraphviz.Agraph(name=N.name, type=pygraphviz.graphviz.cvar.Agdirected) '''  but it should be AGraph, and AGraph doesn't seem to use the 'type' argument anymore.  Also the function uses  '''  node=A.add_node(str(n)) '''  instead of   '''  A.add_node(n)  node=pygraphviz.Node(A,n) '''  Probably there are other issues as well.

Spectral bipartivity measure (migrated from Trac #126)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/126 Reported 2007-10-19 by @drewconway, assigned to @hagberg.  I have been doing research into how the bipartite structure of a network affects various other structural features and metrics.  Recently, there has been a great deal of research into measurements of 'bipartivity', or how bipartite a network is.  Attached is an implementation for NX on one such measure that is derived from spectral graph theory, along with the article that proposes the measure.  As this measurement requires the calculation of eigenvalues, it would be very useful for someone to implement a second version of this function that used the power-iteration method for calculating eigenvalues.  Currently, this functions performs very poorly for moderately sized networks, however, it performs will for N < 1500 with relative density.

Egonet (migrated from Trac #124)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/124 Reported 2007-09-17 by @drewconway, assigned to @hagberg.  I found a need to extract the Egonet of given nodes, so I implemented it into NX.  A node's Egonet is defined as:  ''The neighborhood of an actor is the set of actors they are connected to together with the actors that are connected to them. An ego centered network is the subgraph induced by the set of neighbors. That is the network that consists of all the neighbors and the connections between them.  The idea of an ego network can be extended to a group of actors and the neighborhood is simply the union of the neighborhoods of the group. This procedure returns the adjacency matrix of the ego network and provides an option to include or exclude ego(s) from the network    Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G. and Freeman, L.C. 2002.

Recommended Changes (migrated from Trac #120)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/120 Reported 2007-08-07 by trac user qwerty, assigned to @hagberg.  For the BaseClasses NEP, can we get a listing of recommended coding changes to ease the transition?    The NEP, as currently described, is quite verbose, and it seems that there might be a briefer, more-to-the-point migration guide.  Also, the NEP states, "Edges will be able to have data with a default value of 1(instead of None). The methods used to add edges with or without data will be separated."  Can this be explained a bit?  I don't understand why the methods will be separated if there will be a default value of 1 either way. It seems like this will add extra confusion.  And sorry if this is not the proper place to ask these questions...the wiki was not editable.

Eigenvector centrality enhancement (migrated from Trac #119)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/119 Reported 2007-07-17 by @drewconway, assigned to @hagberg.  I have been using NetworkX for about a month and love its functionality--especially for large networks.  Most of my work is in the analysis of large social networks, and I recently found it necessary to calculate eigenvector centrality, so I wanted to offer my method as an enhancement for future versions of NX.  Eigenvector centrality is a measure of a node's influence based on who it neighbors are connected to.  It is a very useful metric to for comparisons,as unlike degree centrality, not all connections are treated equally.  It accounts for the notion that connections to influential individuals are more significant than simply just connections.  Here is the code:  ''' def eigenvector_centrality(G,v=False):     """     Eigenvector centrality for nodes (a measure of influence, based on     a node's neighbors connections).  ``` Returns a dictionary of eigenvector centrality values keyed by node.

convert_node_labels_to_integers throws TypeError on graph where G.name is not initialized (migrated from Trac #118)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/118 Reported 2007-06-27 by trac user gfriend, assigned to @hagberg.  The offending line is convert_node_labels_to_integers() in /networkx/operators.py (405):  H.name="("+G.name+")_with_int_labels"  Note: No error occurs if G.name == ' ' (empty string). However, G.name == None after G.clear() is called.  I have ran into this problem when calling read_edgelist(file.foo, create_using=XGraph()) and this calls G.clear()  Possible corrections: 1. Do a check in read_edgelist() for empty name 2. Perhaps G.clear() should set G.name = ' ' (empty string)     OR more conservatively, fix read_edgelist()

convert_from_dict_of_dicts doesn't work with incomplete dict_of_dict input (migrated from Trac #116)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/116 Reported 2007-06-20 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  Change r526 which fixed multiedge conversion by directly manipulating G.adj removed the ability to use incomplete dict_of_dicts as input.  If a dict_of_dicts only shows one direction of each edge, the old convert.from_dict_of_dicts using add_edge() produced a valid networkx graph with both direction for each edge, while the new form using G.adj produces a broken networkx data structure.  This impacts the current doctests in sage heavily...     I think this will probably all change when new base classes are introduced to improve weighted graph handling. Also I think we should not guarantee that incomplete dict_of_dicts will work this way in the future. But, I make this ticket to ease life for Robert Miller at Sage in the short term and have suggested that he change the doc tests to use complete dict_of_dicts...

I'm really not sure if this should be a graphviz bug or a pygraphviz bug. However, I'll start here.  Setting an attribute on an edge or node to None causes the graphviz library to segfault. For example: ''' import pygraphviz  > > > G = pygraphviz.AGraph() > > > G.add_node(5) > > > G.get_node(5).attr['color'] = None > > > G.write("/tmp/goingtocrash") > > > Segmentation fault (core dumped) > > > ''' > > > Although in the normal use case people aren't going to be setting parameters to None intentionally it can happen unintentionally and pygraphviz should probably catch it and throw an exception.

Add gzipped data file handling to example scripts (migrated from Trac #104)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/104 Reported 2007-04-23 by trac user KiBi, assigned to @hagberg.  Some distributions' (e.g. Debian and I believe derivatives) policies require some installed files to be compressed, and *.dat files needed by some *.py example scripts belong to this category. It would be fine to have them supporting both compressed (gzipped) and uncompressed data files.  (BTW, it applies to both networkx and pygraphviz, but one can only choose one component at a time.)

brandes_betweenness_centrality is not installed / betweenness_centrality is not correct (migrated from Trac #103)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/103 Reported 2007-04-20 by trac user comellas, assigned to @hagberg.  A line should be included in     **init**.py     to install properly brandes_betweenness_centrality:  ''' from centrality import brandes_betweenness_centrality, \                        betweenness_centrality, \                        degree_centrality, \                        closeness_centrality '''  then brandes_betweenness_centrality can be used.   However it returns a  non normalized betweenness_centrality. I would suggest adding to  the brandes_betweenness_centrality function in the file  centrality.py the following two lines after the comment-question:  '''     # FIXME: divide by 2 for undirected graphs?     for v in G:         betweenness[v]=betweenness[v]/((G.order()-1)*(G.order()-2))     return betweenness   '''  Then the function will return the normalizaed vertex betweenness centrality.

''' Consider for example vertex 0: From vertex 1 there is a shortest path (SP) that goes to vertex 5 throught it and there are in total 2 SP from 1 to 5, so the contribution is 1/2 From vertex 2 to 5 the contribution is 1/3 From vertex 3 to 5 it is 1/4 From 4 it is 1/5 All the other SP contributed nothing. In total:   1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 77/60= 1.28333333 But we have to multiply by 2 as we have also to add the reversed paths.

Use dict-of-sets representation instead of dict-of-dicts representation (migrated from Trac #102)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/102 Reported 2007-04-13 by trac user danb, assigned to @hagberg.  Since python 2.4 added built-in set objects, the dict-of-dicts representation can be refined to a dict-of-sets representation. Sets hash their members just like dicts hash their keys, and this change would make Graph.adj simpler and more readable.

Refactor Base Graph Classes to simplify type-checking and code maintenance (migrated from Trac #101)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/101 Reported 2007-04-13 by @hagberg, assigned to @hagberg.  See wiki:NEP/BaseClass  This NEP proposes a refactoring of the Graph classes in networkx. The need for doing so stems from desire to have a simpler weighted graph class than XGraph and to isolate the type-checking often needed for multiedge graphs. Other goals are to reduce type-checking for edges (2 or 3 tuple), checking for selfloops, and whether data exists for an edge.

XGraph and XDiGraph violate substitutability (migrated from Trac #100)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/100 Reported 2007-04-13 by trac user danb, assigned to @hagberg.  `XGraph` and `XDiGraph` are supposed to subtype `Graph`, but their `edges` methods don't behave like `Graph.edges`: '''  > > > XGraph({1:[2]}).edges() > > > [(1, 2, None)] > > > Graph({1:[2]}).edges() > > > [(1, 2)] > > > '''  This violates the principle of substitutability: an `XGraph` object can't be used like a `Graph` object because `XGraph.edges` returns 3-tuples whereas `Graph.edges` returns 2-tuples.  I propose adding a method named something like `XGraph.labeled_edges` that returns 3-tuples so that `XGraph.edges` can be made to agree with `Graph.edges`.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutability http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle

Documentation clarity on get_edge for XDiGraph (migrated from Trac #93)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/93 Reported 2007-02-15 by trac user qwerty, assigned to @hagberg.  Currently, the documentation for get_edge in XDiGraph states: "Return the objects associated with each edge between n1 and n2."  Internally, the function uses self.adj.  Should the documentation make this explicit and state:  "Return the objects associated with each edge from n1 to n2." ?  It seems we should do the same for DiGraph.  Though, DiGraph is inheriting get_edge from Graph.  Perhaps something like this:  ''' def get_edge(self, n1, n2):    """Return the objects associated with each edge from n1 to n2."""    return Graph.get_edge(n1, n2)  '''

Allow nodes to be passed to number_of_edges() (migrated from Trac #91)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/91 Reported 2007-02-14 by trac user qwerty, assigned to @hagberg.  For multiedges=False, number_of_edges(u,v) should return 1. For multiedges=True, number_of_edges(u,v) should return the number of edges between u and v. If no edge exists, then return 0.  Also, one should be allowed to pass a tuple.  Without this, repetitive code checking for the multiedges attribute must be included.  Since get_edge returns a singlet or a list, it seems best to handle the logic in a single place (dealing with XGraph/Graph differences).  Potentially, this could clean some code up.  Comments?

create_empty_copy creates a copy that is _too_ empty (migrated from Trac #82)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/82 Reported 2007-01-07 by trac user abie, assigned to @hagberg.  I think function create_empty_copy should work like empty_graph.  By this I mean create_empty_copy(G) should produce a graph with 0 edges, and len(G) nodes.  This is not currently the case:  In [34]: G = gnm_random_graph(100, .5)  In [35]: len(G) Out[35]: 100  In [38]: A = empty_graph(100)  In [39]: len(A) Out[39]: 100  In [40]: B = create_empty_copy(G)  In [41]: len(B) Out[41]: 0  If you had other uses in mind and for this it is more appropriate that create_empty_graph(G) be really empty, then consider emphasizing this more prominently in the documentation and docstring.

Graph.degree(nbunch) returns degrees in different order than nbunch. (migrated from Trac #75)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/75 Reported 2006-11-17 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  Currently, the degree method returns a list of degrees for each node in nbunch, but the list is not the same order as the nodes in nbunch.  There is no gaurantee in the docs that the list WILL be in the same order, but its probably what the user would expect.  So, either we should change the docs to wanr about order being different, or find a way to make the order the same.   One problem with testing for this issue is that dicts return different orders depending on history.  I have an idea for a fix, but am looking for a relatively simple test case to make sure it works.

To add nodelist into edgelist (migrated from Trac #70)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/70 Reported 2006-10-24 by yukuan.jiang, assigned to @hagberg.  API of read_edgelist/write_list cannot handle unconnected graph because they ignore the information of isolated nodes.  I suggest adding node list (for all or just isolated nodes) into .edgelist format. Does this make sense?

Could we standardize a method for which edge objects can provide a dictionary to this function?  For example,  if xgraph: # if this is an XGraph or XDiGraph   if isinstance(x,dict): # and the data looks like a dict     A.set_edge_attr((u,v),x)  # use that as the attributes   else:     try:       A.set_edge_attr((u,v),x.dot_attributes())     except:       pass  I have no idea what a good method name would be, but this would things significantly easier for people using networkx with edge objects.

DOT properties (migrated from Trac #51)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/51 Reported 2006-08-02 by rmrichardson, assigned to @hagberg.  It would be very nice to have a standard way of accessing the attributes contained in a DOT file and still work with NetworkX graphs.  Right now, the code that convertes Agraphs -> NWX ignores the attributes.  This is a pain, since then I need to either dump the attributes to a dictionary manually or keep both the Agraph and NWX graph data around. I noticed that the code is marked with this as an eventual improvement--for interoperability with DOT I think this should be a priority.  Thanks!

Proposal for changing shortest paths interface to work generically with single-source or bidirectional algorithm and weighted graphs.  = Proposal =  The generic shortest_path and shortest_path_length should attempt to infer what algorithm to call based on arguments and graph type  === Changes === - shortest_path -> single_source_shortest_path - bidirectional_shortest_path -> bidirectional_shortest_path (no change) - dijkstra -> single_source_dijkstra - dijkstra_bi -> bidirectional_dijkstra - shortest_path = new code that calls either single_source_shortest_path or bidirectdional_shortest_path depending on argument (has target or not). Also attepts to infer weighted graph and call correct dijkstra function - shortest_path_length = new code that does len() on shortest_path results (might be slower?) - dijkstra_path = new code that calls single_source_dijkstra or bidirectional_dijkstra - dijkstra_path_length = new code that does len() on dijkstra_path results  === Misc === - need to choose bidirectional_shortest_path or bidirectional_shortest_path2, they are the same speed - perhaps update bidirectional_dijkstra in more pythonic idiom?

neighbors use of with_labels doesn't match docs or "theme" of with_labels elsewhere. (migrated from Trac #38)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/38 Reported 2006-05-16 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  neighbors() returns a list of tuples when with_labels=True.  The theme for the package is to return a dict when with_labels=True (at least that is my  understanding).  The iterators return tuples when with_labels=True. Perhaps the whole with_labels API needs to be revisited  to make a consistent, or at least a more clear, specification of its intent. Personally, I like the as_dict/as_list/as_set keyword argument system, but it has been rightfuly criticized as being to oriented to the python  language as opposed to the graph metaphor.  Another approach would be to always return a specific form that has enough info to let users convert  to any other data structure.  i.e. neighbors(v) always returns a list, degree(v) returns a single value and degree() returns a dict (or listof tuples if that is  preferred.)  neighbors_iter(v) would iterate through the neighbors and not  have with_labels as an option.

I put a system in for using numpy or Numeric in the spectrum  and threshold modules, but it uses numpy if both are available. Users ought to be able to use either numpy or Numeric because some packages don't support numpy yet.  I'm not if it is worth putting a lot of effort into this since Numeric will presumably  be phased out, but if I have to overcome it anyway......

improve shortest path memory usage (migrated from Trac #26)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/26 Reported 2006-02-21 by jfd, assigned to @hagberg.  The current implementation of shortest_path() uses a lot of memory to construct a dict of complete paths to the target node. As I understand it, it is only really neccesary to specify the next node in the path.  E.g. if there is the graph A->B->C->D. Instead of returning something like: { A: [A, B, C, D] B: [B, C, D] C: [C, D] D: [D] }  It would be better to say {A: B, B: C, C: D}  from which generators for each path can be constructed to keep with the current API.  ''' # !python  def shortest_path(G,source,target=None,cutoff=None):     if target==source: return []  # trivial path     level=0                  # the current level     nextlevel=set([source])       # set of nodes to check at next level     paths={source:source}  # paths hash  (paths to key from source)     while nextlevel:         thislevel=nextlevel         nextlevel=set()         for v in thislevel:             for w in G.neighbors(v):                 if not paths.has_key(w):                     paths[w]=v                     if w==target:      # Shortcut if target is not None                         return paths[w]                     nextlevel.add(w)         level=level+1 etc. '''

DiGraph's definition for neighbors() doesn't work with search algorithms (migrated from Trac #25)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/25 Reported 2006-01-27 by @dschult, assigned to @hagberg.  DiGraph.neighbors() returns both successors and predecessors, but the search algorithms we have coded assume that neighbors() yields only successors (it was developed primarily for Graphs).  Possible fixes include: - changing the search algorithms, (and looking for other uses of neighbors in other places). - changing the neighbors() API for DiGraph to return successors() only. - changing the Graph API to use successors instead of neighbors.

Add functions to allow node and edge mappings to other types when reading from an ascii file.  Currently all you can get are strings.

get_edge with multiedges returns actual edge list instead of copy (migrated from Trac #22)#TITLE_END#Original ticket https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ticket/22 Reported 2006-01-07 by dschult, assigned to @dschult.  When using multiedges, the method get_edge returns the actual list from self.adj so that graph manipulations affect the returned value (potentially well after the get_edge) and if the user changes the list it affects the graph directly.  XGraph and XDiGraph both have this potential issue.

The configuration model source:networkx/trunk/networkx/generators/degree_seq.py#14 uses a Graph() datatype that doesn't allow for parallel edges or self loops. This is the typical model used in the physics community.  Using instead the XGraph(selfloops=True,multiedges=True) type will give a graph with the exact degree sequence requested - the parallel edges and self loops can be removed if desired.

I think it would be handy to make a small method for a graph that prints a little nicely-formatted list of statistics about the net, so you can get a quick overview of the graph.  For example: '''  ```    type              undirected, simple    number of nodes   56    number of edges   102    size              15807 bytes    created           19:32 9/8/05    etc               ? ```  '''  As you can see, this method would just call existing stuff and format the results.  I think it would be very handy at an interactive prompt.  Is there a networkxrc file or something similar?  Then you could use that to customize what G.info() outputs.  Let me know what you think,[[BR]] Jim
