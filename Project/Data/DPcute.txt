issue
mismatch in the order of colours and edge widths #TITLE_END#The mismatch arises when the numbers of nodes and edges get larger, which I illustrate through the example attached. i.e., where I asked the edge between A and B to be red, and B-C to be grey; it comes out that A-C is grey and B-C is red.
