@rossbar  i would like to work on this issue but I am unable to edit this PR can I raise a separate PR for this
comment
@dschult  i would like to know can we modify the documentation of traids as the given documentation shows for directed graph but can also be used as undirected .
comment
@dschult  i think this would work  ` Note: For undirected networks, create a triadic census by converting the graph to a directed graph using G.to_directed(). Only the triad types 003, 102, 201, and 300 will arise in the undirected case.`
