Example fix for issue 7633#TITLE_END#Modified plot_maximum_independent_set.py (changed seed to 251134665)  So that it shows a better example of the graph.  Document needs to be modified  Closes #7633

I've read through the relevant code.    I think this happens because the line of code used to check for the case where nbunch is a single node,          `elif nbunch in self:  # if nbunch is a single node` (in line 2004 of graph.py) can only filter out single nodes that are in self, and single nodes that are not in self get tossed to the else statement later on. This works, but without the correct error message as mentioned.   One method of possibly solving this is to change/ add an elif statement that appropriately raises a NetworkXError "nbunch(or node) is not in self(or G/ sequence)."  I'm not familiar on the ways around this codebase, so I ask for advice on how I should solve this.

@rossbar   I forgot to add this. 😢

@dschult @akshitasure12 Thank you for your reply.   This is what I've understood :  1. G.degree does too much things in the first place, and it would be better in the long run to have dictionary construction && lookup replace view classes.  -- While removing the function interface is a way of solving that, we could also possibly nudge people to use dictionaries by providing a more convenient method. The function could do the construction && lookups for the users, but I can't come up with anything more right now.  2. We could change the error messages in nbunch_iter  I think we could possibly add a if block under `except TypeError as err:` to catch the following error :  `"TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable"`  Currently, this is included in this block of code : ```                     if "iter" in message:                         exc = NetworkXError(                             "nbunch is not a node or a sequence of nodes."                         ) ```  We can modify it to this :  ```                 except TypeError as err:                     exc, message = err, err.args[0]                     # capture error for non-sequence/iterator nbunch.                     if "iter" in message:                         exc = NetworkXError(                             "nbunch is not a node or a sequence of nodes."                         )                     # capture error for integer nbunch that is not in G.                     if "int" in message:                         exc = NetworkXError(                             f"Node {nbunch} is not in the graph."                         ) ```  The added block( the second one ) overrides the error message from the previous block.  I also think it's really neat since it can specify the node.  _However, further consideration is needed as the line_ `if "int" in message` might catch other unexpected errors. I want to know if there is something that rings a bell. (Maybe adj could somehow become an integer and raise an error?)  For this, we would also have to modify the tests. ( I tested after the changes and got thrown with 12 failures ) ex) bunch = G.nbunch_iter(-1) would be catched better with the new message  + Would there be any better error messages?  3. We could modify DegreeView for an error message  -- This is indeed valid, but as far as I have read, there weren't any other instances of error handling in this part of the codebase. I think it is in the realm of good practice to keep the error handling in designated places(in this case, nbunch_iter), since putting them all over would make maintenance more difficult.   Sorry for the late reply. I caught a harsh cold && went on vacation for new year's.  + @akshitasure12 , if you don't mind, I would like to wrap up this issue.

I've read through the tests for nbunch in test_graph.py with the blame view.  "Node {nbunch} is not in the graph" looks perfectly good for the error message.   I think the original message "... not a sequence of nodes" was intended for the edge case which is catched by the second block(elif) and the NetworkXError that is thrown with the inclusion of "iter" in the error message.  Besides that, our error message is the equivalent of the original, only with added clarity.   This seems to close #7740. I want to note the possibility of new functionality that uses dictionaries for faster lookups that was discussed here.   I will create a pull request that implements the changes that have been mentioned here. I will also update the relevant documentation && tests.

Hi everyone! I took care of this by changing the seed to 251134665. I did try from 1~100 but they were all unsuccessful, so I started changing the order of the vertices and it also worked with 134. But I lost progress in failing to save, and I just put random numbers in and 251134665 was what I found. It show 14 independent(not overlapping) vertices that without overlapping points.  [https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7634/commits](url)  This is the first ever commit I've ever made to an open source project!
