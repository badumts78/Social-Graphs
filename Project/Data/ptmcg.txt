I've looked at this, and the issue is due to the tightening up of whitespace-skipping that was pushed out in 3.0.2. This is intentional behavior. To correct in pydot, add the two lines shown below to dot_parser.py (I can submit as a PR if you prefer):          noncomma = "".join([c for c in printables if c != ","])         alphastring_ = OneOrMore(CharsNotIn(noncomma + " "))         # ========== add the following two lines ==============         # override pyparsing tightened whitespace-skipping logic         alphastring_.skipWhitespace = True  `CharsNotIn` has always suppressed whitespace, but in pyparsing 3.0, it is intended to preserve this whitespace-skipping suppression when enclosed in a surrounding expression. My understanding of `alphastring_` is that it should collect non-comma characters after skipping over any initial whitespace. Adding this line passes the test suite. (The added comment is optional, but I thought it would be useful to document this atypical attribute setting.)  This fix also will address issues with pydot in networkx (https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/issues/338).  _[Sorry, posted on the wrong project - reposted on pydot.]_
