show_edges() based on show_nodes() fails#TITLE_END#Creating a subgraph with show_edges() based on a subgraph created with show_nodes() fails.  ### Current Behavior Passing the resulting subgraph to nx.draw() results in an undecipherable exception.  ### Expected Behavior The subgraph should preferably work or at least throw an understandable exception.  ### Steps to Reproduce      import networkx as nx     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      g = nx.from_edgelist( [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,0),(1,4)] )     f = nx.classes.filters.show_nodes( [0,1,4,5] )     sg = nx.subgraph_view( g, f )     ff = nx.classes.filters.show_edges( [(5,0),(1,4)] )     ssg = nx.subgraph_view( sg, ff )     nx.draw(ssg)     plt.savefig('plot.png')  ### Environment Python version: 3.7.4 NetworkX version: 2.5 (via conda-forge)   ### Additional context None
