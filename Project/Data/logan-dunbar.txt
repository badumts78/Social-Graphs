Can't retrieve all edges for pair of nodes in Multi(Di)Graph#TITLE_END#<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> According to the docs, I should be able to subscript into Multi(Di)Graph by pair of nodes and retrieve all the edges:  > Hence, **G.edges[u, v]['color']** provides the value of the color attribute for edge (u, v) while for (u, v, c) in G.edges(data='color', default='red'): iterates through all the edges yielding the color attribute. [Docs](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.MultiGraph.edges.html)  Either the docs are incorrect (I suspect a copy-paste from non-Multi Graph/DiGraph), or this does not work as expected.  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> ```python G = nx.MultiGraph()  # or MultiDiGraph nx.add_path(G, [0, 1, 2]) key = G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=5) G.edges[1, 2] # G.edges[1, 2, 0] or G.edges[1, 2, 1] works ```  > ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)  ### Expected Behavior <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  I would expect to be able to retrieve all the (multi-)edges for a pair of nodes by subscripting into the edges of the MultiGraph: ```python G.edges[1, 2] ```  > MultiEdgeView([(1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 1)])  ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.8 NetworkX version: 2.6.1
