Added test cases for join operation and fixed join operation to handle label_attributes#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> Fixes #6488 and fixes #6490  @MridulS  Modified join operation to store label_attributes and handled the case when label_attribute argument is provided. Added test cases for join operation to check label_attributes. Could you please check the PR and suggest any changes if needed to be done.  https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.tree.operations.join.html In the documentation its written that Input has to be list of trees but this function works for graphs as well. Should I change the documentation by replacing trees with graphs or modify the join function to not accept list of graphs as input?

Test case to check label_attribute should be added  2. In the documentation its written that the inputs must be tree. But this function works for graphs too.

 updated join function by storing old labels#TITLE_END#<!-- Please run black to format your code. See https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/developer/contribute.html for details. --> fixes #6488  Deleted the code of removing old labels to maintain them in the resultant graph and replaced "_old" with the variable, label_attribute to handle cases where label_attribute argument is provided.
