I have tried the following approach. ````python def _write_partition(self, partition):`               partition_dict = partition.partition_dict         partition_key = self.partition_key         G = self.G          #Handling multi-graphs         if G.is_multigraph():             for u, v, k, d in G.edges(keys= True, data = True):                 edge = (u, v, k)                 d[partition_key] = partition_dict.get(edge, EdgePartition.OPEN)                  else:             for u, v, d in G.edges(data=True):                 edge = (u, v)                 d[partition_key] = partition_dict.get(edge, EdgePartition.OPEN)  def _clear_partition(self, G):         """         Removes partition data from the graph         """         partition_key = self.partition_key         edges = G.edges(keys=True, data=True) if G.is_multigraph() else G.edges(data=True)         for *e, d in edges:             if partition_key in d:                 del d[partition_key] ```` This worked fine for some test cases I tried.
