issue
`eulerian_circuit` returns walk that uses the same edge twice when it should not.#TITLE_END#<!-- If you have a general question about NetworkX, please use the discussions tab to create a new discussion -->  <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above --> It's possible for `eulerian_circuit` circuit to return a list of edges with duplicates if the duplicate usage does not have the nodes in the same order. In a euler circuit, each edge must be used exactly once.  ### Current Behavior <!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> It succeeds with a walk that uses the same edge more than once.  ### Expected Behavior It should fail when a euler circuit is not possible.  ### Steps to Reproduce <!--- Provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug --> ```python import networkx as nx G = nx.cycle_graph(9) G.remove_edge(0, 8) G.add_edge(0, 3) G.add_edge(4, 8) G = nx.eulerize(G) print(f"euler circuit: {list(nx.eulerian_circuit(G))}") ``` Output: ``` euler circuit: [(0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 8), (8, 7), (7, 6), (6, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 0)] ``` Note that edge (3, 4) is used twice, but the second use is (4, 3). This is the same edge because the graph is undirected. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1808807/116125468-85cadd00-a693-11eb-962e-61beccd266c9.png)   ### Environment <!--- Please provide details about your local environment --> Python version: 3.9 NetworkX version: 2.5.1   ### Additional context <!--- Add any other context about the problem here, screenshots, etc. -->
