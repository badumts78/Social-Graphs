add joint degree construction algorithm?#TITLE_END#Hello,  I am a researcher at the University of California, Irvine and I would like to contribute to the Networkx project by writing a new graph construction algorithm that we have recently published in a peer-reviewed Computer Science conference. More specifically, the graph construction algorithm receives as input a  realizable Joint Degree Matrix (JDM) and **provably** always  produces a simple undirected graph that has exactly the input JDM. Our paper titled "Construction of Simple Graphs with a Target Joint Degree Matrix and Beyond" was published in [IEEE Infocom 2015](http://infocom2015.ieee-infocom.org/) and is [freely available here](http://minasgjoka.com/papers/mgjoka_infocom15.pdf)  Conveniently, Networkx already has a function to calculate the Joint degree Matrix using either of the functions degree_mixing_matrix or degree_mixing_dict  e.g.   ``` >>> import networkx >>> g = networkx.Graph([(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(1,4),(2,5),(2,6),(4,6)]) >>> _joint_degree_dict_ = networkx.degree_mixing_dict(g,normalized=False) >>> print(_joint_degree_dict_) {1: {4: 1}, 2: {2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}, 3: {2: 2, 4: 1}, 4: {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1}} ```  As it can be seen, the Joint Degree describes the number of edges between nodes of degree "k" and degree "l" in the graph. For example in graph "g" above, there is 1 edge between nodes of degree 1 and 4, 2 edges between nodes of degree 2 and 2, 2 edges between nodes of degree 2 and 3, 2 edges between nodes of degree 2 and 4 and so on.  The proposed algorithm, named **joint_degree_simple_graph**, takes as input _joint_degree_dict_, then assesses whether it is realizable, and finally constructs a random instance of a simple undirected graph that has exactly the input joint_degree_dict:  ``` >>> g_constructed = joint_degree_simple_graph(_joint_degree_dict_) ```  Would the Networkx community be interested in the addition of such a construction algorithm?  If yes, please advise where would the most appropriate file to add it. Is it perhaps networkx/networkx/generators/degree_seq.py ? Also, any other advice for a new contributor to the Networkx project would be welcome.  Thank you Minas Gjoka

Created two new files: joint_degree_seq.py and test_joint_degree_seq.…#TITLE_END#I created two new files: joint_degree_seq.py and test_joint_degree_seq.py . Inside joint_degree_seq.py I added functions for validity check (is_valid_joint_degree) and graph construction (joint_degree_model) for a given joint degree. Inside  test_joint_degree_seq.py I added tests for the latter two main functions. File joint_degree_seq.py also has a helper function named _neighbor_switch (which is called inside joint_degree_model).  This is a follow up for feature proposed [by me at this post](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1996)  and accepted by Aric Hagberg.  Let me know if you have any feedback.
