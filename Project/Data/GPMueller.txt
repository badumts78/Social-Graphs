Graph attributes missing in dotfile output?#TITLE_END#If I understand attributes correctly, the graph itself should also be able to have attributes (e.g. `rankdir=BT` to invert the ordering). The only way I currently know how to add them is via the constructor: ```Python import networkx as nx G = nx.DiGraph(rankdir="BT") G.add_edge("A", "B") nx.drawing.nx_pydot.write_dot(G, 'test.dot') ``` I would expect this to give me a dotfile containing ``` strict digraph  { rankdir=BT; A; B; A -> B; } ```  **The `rankdir=BT;` attribute is missing. Is this expected/intended behaviour or is it maybe a bug?**  *Note: I believe that `get`/`set` functions for graph attributes would be nice to have.*  --------------------------------  If I modify a single line in the `to_pydot` function:  https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/98e0a6ebd25a0183b6a0f6375cccaf5619209b59/networkx/drawing/nx_pydot.py#L201  to read `graph_defaults = N.graph`, then the output is expected.
