AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'gridmap_to_nx.<locals>.filter_node'#TITLE_END#I have created a subgraph_view (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.subgraph_view.html#networkx.classes.function.subgraph_view).   Now I can not pickle it. This is probably because of the `filter_node`, which is obviously a function. Do you have any idea how I can still pickle the `subgraph_view`?
