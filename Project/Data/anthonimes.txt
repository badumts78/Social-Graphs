issue
adding a formula that ignores self-loops at the each level of directed louvain algorithm#TITLE_END#I recently came across a small bug when running `louvain` on directed graphs: the algorithm always stopped after a first step and hence did not compute the hierarchical structure.   This seems to come from the fact that self-loops are considered at the initialization step. It follows that every vertex is added back to its own community and no improvement is made, causing the `while` to stop.   The proposed fix has been tested on two separate graphs and seems correct (a comparison has been made with the [C++ implementation](https://github.com/nicolasdugue/DirectedLouvain) of the algorithm).
