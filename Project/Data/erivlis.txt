Add time series Visibility Graph generator#TITLE_END#    Return a Visibility Graph of an input Time Series.      It converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph inherits several properties of the series in its     structure. Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, and random series do so into random graphs.     Moreover, fractal series convert into scale-free networks.     -- https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0709247105      Parameters     ----------     series: Iterable[float]        Time Series iterable of float values      Returns     -------     NetworkX graph         The Visibility Graph of series      Examples     --------     >>> import networkx as nx     >>> from matplotlib import pyplot     >>>     >>> series_list = [range(10), [2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3]]     >>>     >>> for s in series_list:     ...     g = nx.visibility_graph(s)     ...     print(g)     ...     # Uncomment the following lines to plot the graph     ...     # pos = [[x, 0] for x in range(len(s))]     ...     # labels = nx.get_node_attributes(g, 'value')     ...     # nx.draw_networkx_nodes(g, pos)     ...     # nx.draw_networkx_labels(g, pos, labels=labels)     ...     # nx.draw_networkx_edges(g, pos, arrows=True, connectionstyle='arc3,rad=-1.57079632679')     ...     # pyplot.show()     Graph with 10 nodes and 9 edges     Graph with 12 nodes and 18 edges      References     ----------     ..
