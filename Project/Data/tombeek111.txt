Linestyle not set for directed graph with errors at draw_networkx_edges#TITLE_END#When plotting a directed graph, linestyle is not set      import networkx as nx     from matplotlib import pyplot as plt      G = nx.DiGraph()     G.add_nodes_from([0,1])     G.add_edge(0,1)      pos = {0 : (0,0), 1 : (1,0)}      plt.figure()     nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G,pos=pos)     nx.draw_networkx_edges(G,pos=pos,style='dashed',arrows=True)      plt.show()      This results in a solid line between two nodes, instead of a dashed one. If arrows is set to False, the line is dashed, but of course there is no arrow anymore.
