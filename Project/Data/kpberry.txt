Weighted karate club graph#TITLE_END#Hello everyone! I noticed that the original paper for Zachary's karate club has weights on the graph, but the version that networkx loads is unweighted. I wasn't able to find a copy of the graph with the edge weights online, so I updated them by hand and updated karate_club_graph to load the weighted edges when passed the optional parameter weighted=True.   Because I typed the graph myself while referring to the paper, I have removed the link to the UCI datasets from the karate_club_graph documentation.  In order to ensure the code is tested, I updated the weighted louvain test to load the karate graph as weighted and assert that the detected communities for graphs with different weights are different from each other.  It is also worth mentioning that I have set the default value of weighted to False. While I think that weighted=True is a better default, since it reflects the original context of the network and provides useful extra information, there are some test cases within networkx that implicitly rely on the karate graph being unweighted, and I would imagine there to be a decent amount of code/tests in other libraries that depends on the graph being unweighted as well. I think it would be reasonable to update those test cases, but I would prefer not to break other code unexpectedly without a strong enough reason.

Faster operators in algorithms/operators/all.py#TITLE_END#TL;DR: I rewrote the operators in algorithms/operators/all.py to take linear time instead of quadratic time, and I rewrote the corresponding operators in algorithms/operators/binary.py in terms of the *_all operators instead of the other way around.  Hey everyone! I noticed that the operators in algorithms/operators/all.py (e.g., union_all, intersection_all, etc.), simply call the corresponding operators from algorithms/operators/binary.py repeatedly, which causes their run times to all be quadratic with respect to the number of graphs. However, they can all be implemented easily in linear time, so I went ahead and did that. Since the binary operations are also special cases of the *_all operations and there's not a significant overhead to process multiple graphs vs. a pair of graphs, I rewrote the binary operators in terms of the *_all operators (which keeps the duplicated code to a minimum).  This refactor doesn't change the signatures/outputs of these functions, so I don't think any documentation change is directly necessary for this (though there are other documentation changes for these files in #5099).
