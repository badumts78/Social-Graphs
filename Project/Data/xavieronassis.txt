Steinertree kou enhancement in response to issue 5889 type:Enhancements#TITLE_END#In follow up to issue #5889  I implemented a backward compatible enhancement by only changing the _kou_steiner_tree function in  steinertree.py. So far it passed all tests and shows significant speed up.   This is my first ever time using GitHub, I am not sure if I am contributing correctly.  There is also a possibe improvement in the for loop on line 98, where it currently adds edges (u, v) and (v, u), although one may argue that it adds a generalization to directed graphs.  PS: It may also be considered to change the documentation of steinertree to reflect that time complexity of Kou algorithm is O(|S|(|E|+|V|log|V|)), the reason why in original paper the time complexity was shown as O(|S||V|^2) is because back when Kou's paper was published the more efficient Dijkstra implementation was not known.
