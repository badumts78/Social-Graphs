Fixed typo in tensor product documentation (Fixes #7228)#TITLE_END#Hi,  A very quick PR for a type in the tensor product documentation. This Fixes #7228  Thanks
issue
Typo in Tensor Product Documentation#TITLE_END#### Current Behavior Currently, in the documentation, the definition of the node set of the product says, it is the **tensor** product of the node sets. This is incorrect, as the tensor product is not applicable to sets and does not correspond to the sci. definition.   ### Expected Behavior The **Cartesian** product of the node set provides the correct (and implemented) mathematical operation.
