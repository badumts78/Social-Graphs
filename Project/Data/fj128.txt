Remove unused variable so grid_graph() supports dim=tuple#TITLE_END#Trying to give a tuple of dimensions to networkx.grid_graph results in an exception:      from networkx import grid_graph     G = grid_graph(dim=(2, 3, 4))        File "[..]\Python38-32\lib\site-packages\networkx\generators\lattice.py", line 130, in grid_graph                 dlabel = "%s" % dim     TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting  That's despite the documentation saying "dim : list **or tuple** of numbers or iterables of nodes"  Well, since that variable is a leftover from some previous refactoring and is unused, we can just remove it.  I also changed the syntax to tuples in the documentation examples (because it's slightly more efficient and so a better style) and manually verified with doctest. This can also help with detecting regressions, though I'm not sure if your pytest configuration runs doctests.
