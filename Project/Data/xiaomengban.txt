issue
why gdal==1.10.0 in requirements?#TITLE_END#Hi,  When running the pip command (```pip install networkx[all]```), I ran into GDAL setup error.  I was surprised by the error, because GDAL (version 2.2.2) was already installed on my desktop: ``` pip show gdal Name: GDAL Version: 2.2.2 Summary: GDAL: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library Home-page: http://www.gdal.org ... ```  Looking at [networkx distutils requirements](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/requirements/extras.txt), I realized that GDAL requires strictly 1.10.0 version for GDAL: ``` pygraphviz>=1.5 pydot>=1.2.4 gdal==1.10.0 ```  **Question** Is there a particular reason why ```gdal==1.10.0```, instead of ```gdal>=1.10.0```? Having a strict version usually makes the lib install error-prone. Thanks in advance.
