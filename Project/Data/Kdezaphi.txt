spring_layout divide by zero when there is one fixed parameter#TITLE_END#I am attempting to use the spring layout with some nodes fixed. When there is only one node fixed I have errors like in this minimal code: ``` import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge(0, 1) pos = nx.spring_layout(G, pos = {G.nodes()[0]:(0.5,0.5)}, fixed = [0]) ```  There are those erros: ``` /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py:343: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in true_divide   .sum(axis=1) /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py:343: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide   .sum(axis=1) /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py:343: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply   .sum(axis=1) /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py:346: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in less   length=np.where(length<0.01,0.01,length) /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/networkx/drawing/layout.py:339: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in less   distance=np.where(distance<0.01,0.01,distance) ```  And this returns: ``` print(pos) {0: array([ 0.5,  0.5]), 1: array([ nan,  nan])} ```
