issue
compute the average_shortest_path_length for the components of multi-directed graph got a 'not implemented for directed type' exception#TITLE_END#I'd like to calculate the `average_shortest_path_length` in my multi-directed graph but there is a node not connected with other nodes ![figure_1-1.png](https://ooo.0o0.ooo/2017/03/07/58be169a5d952.png)  but according to the notes in [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.generic.average_shortest_path_length.html?highlight=average%20path%20length#networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.generic.average_shortest_path_length) > For disconnected graphs you can compute the average shortest path length for each component: >>> G=nx.Graph([(1,2),(3,4)]) >>> for g in nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G): ... print(nx.average_shortest_path_length(g)) 1.0 1.0   it should work with components, so I try the code before ```python for g in nx.connected_component_subgraphs(sub_MDG):     print nx.average_shortest_path_length(g) ``` but ends up with an exception like `networkx.exception.NetworkXNotImplemented: not implemented for directed type` however if I remove the single node from the network,I can compute the average shortest path length for the network, so I wonder how I can calculate the average shortest path length in a multi-directed graph with several node not connected?
issue
`Accessing edges` of tutorial#TITLE_END#When I am trying the sample one by one through the tutorial of NetworkX, I found a trivial error in the end of chapter of `Accessing edges`  ``` for (u,v,d) in FG.edges(data='weight'):       if d<0.5: print('(%d, %d, %.3f)'%(n,nbr,d)) ``` and here I thought it should be  `      if d<0.5: print('(%d, %d, %.3f)'%(u,v,d))`
comment
It works exactly the same for `MultiDiGraph`
