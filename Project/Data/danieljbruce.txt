issue
Isomorphism for edge matching doesn't seem to work the way I think it should#TITLE_END#Running the following script should print `True`, but it throws an error that says `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'get'`. I'm not too sure if I am using this improperly or if there is an error in the library.  ``` import networkx as nx import networkx.algorithms.isomorphism as iso  G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=2) H = nx.Graph() H.add_edge(1, 2, weight=2) em = iso.numerical_multiedge_match('weight', 0, rtol=1e-6) print(nx.is_isomorphic(G, H, edge_match=em)) ```
