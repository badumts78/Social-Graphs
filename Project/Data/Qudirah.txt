comment
I just checked the function and it is understandable. The docstrings are well explanatory and it should work well. Is there anything, in particular, you'll like me to try?
comment
>   Can I make this correction?
comment
@BrunoBaldissera are you done with this issue?
comment
>  This function requires that the graph be connected. In the case where graph G only contains a single node (as in the example you provided, where we only added node 0 to G), the Laplacian centrality cannot be computed because the Laplacian matrix of the graph is not well-defined. This is all I can think of @rossbar 
comment
> Hi, yes you're absolutely right @Qudirah However, in normal cases laplacian centrality _should_ be defined for matrices with singular nodes. We'll have to come up with a way for that. That's what was covered in the discussion with @dschult and @rossbar.  oh! Thanks for the explanation. 
comment
@rossbar I want to work on this but I do not understand the conclusion much. Can you help with it?
comment
> You need to add `is_tournament` to the main namespace. That means if someone does `import networkx as nx`, and then they do `nx.is_` and hit a tab for autocomplete, `nx.is_tournament` should show up. >  > Currently someone needs to first import the `tournament` subpackage and then they will be able to use the `is_tournament` function. To fix this you need to go look at the `__init__.py` files in `networkx/__init__.py` and `tournament/__init__.py`  Thank you @MridulS. will get on that rn.

@sirichandana-v are you working on this?

@MridulS Should I work on catching the error?
comment
@jarrodmillman Can I add your hint suggestion to the doc?

@dschult this issue should be closed then?

@MridulS this is solved. The issue should be closed.
comment
Hello @MridulS, I think this issue is either resolved or not necessary. The error is in line 158 of https://app.codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/flow/maxflow.py and the function test_kwargs_default_flow_func() solves it. This is because if the flow_func is none, it becomes default and the kwargs is supplied in this function which summarizes that line. Please let me know what you think.
comment
@rossbar please help check this out?
comment
@MridulS I think this needs to be closed. Seems like a deadlock.

@rossbar the pr linked to it is meant to close it. #6496 
comment
This issue should be closed. @dschult   Sorry I keep tagging you everywhere. I just want to keep things tidy so people can work on issues that haven't been worked on. :)
comment
> > This issue should be closed. >  > Hi @Qudirah - no need to keep pinging about issues like this: this issue will automatically be closed if/when #6459 is merged. Other developers can see that there's an open PR to fix this issue, which means they should direct their effort to reviewing that PR rather than submitting a new one.  Oh. Makes a lot of sense. Sorry about that.

Probably the best way to get a clear description of the normalization procedure is to investigate the paper referenced in the docstring.  Alright. I'll look into that.
