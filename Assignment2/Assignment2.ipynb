    "The questions in this part are based on Lecture 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Present an analysis/description of the network of bands/artists using tools from Lecture 5. Imagine that you have been tasked with presenting the important facts about the network to an audience who knows about network science, but doesn't know about this particular network.\n",
    "   - It's OK to also use basic concepts like degree distributions (even though they're from week 4) in your analysis. That way you can make the analysis a standalone, coherent thing.\n",
    "   - I would like you to include concepts like centrality and assortativity in your analysis.\n",
    "   - Use a network backbone in your analysis.\n",
    "   - In addition to standard distribution plots (e.g. degree distributions, etc), your analysis should also include at least one network visualization (but it doesn't have to display the entire network, you can also visualize a network backbone).\n",
    "   - **Note**: As I write above, an important part of the exercise consists is *selecting the right elements of the lecture* to create a meaningful analysis. So don't solve this part by going exhaustive and just calculating everything you can think of in one massive analysis. Try to focus on using what you've learned to characterize the network. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now let’s get into the topic of TF-IDF. Before explaining the maths and formulas, let’s first start with the intuition. Given a statistic for distinguishing words in a page in a book, we would intuitively look at the most common word. However, this would most likely be a word that is common in ALL pages of the book, words like: the, be, to and of. To fix this, we should not only weigh words by how common they are in the single page of the book, but also by how common they are in ALL of the pages of the book. This is the intuition behind TF-IDF. We calculate how common a word is in a single document, and then we weigh it by how common that word is in the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use TF-IDF to identify words that are specific to certain genres. we can then relate these words to certain communities to infer which genres represents which community. Say we use TF-IDF on the page for Hip Hop music, we could find identifying words like \"rap, beats, 808s\". If we then relate these words to a community found within our network, we can reasonably confidently say that that community represents the Hip Hop genre of music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now apply TF-IDF to our own dataset. First we have to extract all the genres per artist, as the assignment mentioned to do this using LLM coding, see the code below."
